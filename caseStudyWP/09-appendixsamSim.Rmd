# SamSim MODEL DOCUMENTATION {#app:third-appendix}

SamSim is the closed loop simulation modelling tool used for calculation of the projection based LRPs. An overview of SamSim and the code can be found in project [github page](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP). Samsim includes two population levels, it could be applied to one Conservation Unit (CU) with component sites, or one Stock Management Unit (SMU) with component CUs, OR even one region with component SMUs. For the LRP analysis two SMUs and their component CUs were used as Study cases: the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook SMU (with five CUs) and the Interior Fraser Coho Salmon SMU (with three CUs). This appendix describes the samSim model equations relevant to these study cases.
The following sections in this appendix are organized similarly to the samSim code, for this reason the subheadings of this appendix can be read as pseudo code. The simulation model has two main phases: Model Priming and Projections. The model priming phase recreates data for past years, either by populating objects with observed data or by generating population trends based on input parameters. The projection phase generates data for future years based on the input data and parameters as well as the user defined scenarios and management procedures. . The model indexes are defined in Table \@ref(tab:indtab), the model parameters and model input are defined in Table \@ref(tab:paramtab) parameters and the modeled quantities are defined in Table \@ref(tab:modtab). Detailed definitions of the input data and parameters are provided in the project [README](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP#readme).

### Model Priming


The priming phase, or model initialization, represents the past data for CUs being modeled. It is used to represent real and observed abundances before starting the projection trials. This phase loops over a number of past years ('nPrime') and reconstructs recruitment time series for past years. The simulations can be initialized in two ways: with existing recruitment data or with user defined parameters, if recruitment data is not available.  

#### Recruitment Data is available

If spawner-recruitment data is available, the number of initialization years 'nPrime' is defined based on the length of the longest CU time series available. The Spawners, Recruits, Catch and Exploitation Rate objects are populated with the input data. If catch and/or exploitation rate data are not available, those values are set to zero.

#### Recruitment Data is not available

When Recruitment data is not available, the 'nPrime' is set to 10 times the maximum age of recruits. Because the stock recruitment data is not available, the first step on this routine is to retrieve the stock recruitment parameters. The user has the option of providing either fixed values or a set of mcmc samples. If mcmc samples are provided, one set of parameters is used for each simulation trial.

The spawner recruitment parameters can be adjusted according to the user defined scenarios. samSim includes options to adjust the productivity parameter, $\alpha_{i}$, the capacity parameter $\beta_{i}$, and the recruitment standard deviations, $\sigma_{i}$. The LRP case studies do not include adjustments or changes in productivity over time, therefore we will not describe the parameter adjustment options in in this report. Recruitment is assumed to be correlated between the CU's, the covariance matrix is calculated based on the variance-covariance matrix and the correlation matrix specified by the user.   
 

Once parameters are defined the number of spawners, $S_{y,i}$, is initialized. The number of spawners is set at equilibrium for the first 6 years and then calculated based on recruitment  and exploitation rates in the previous years (equation \@ref(eq:Seqinit)). If the calculated number of spawners is lower than the user inputted extinction threshold, then the number of spawners is set o zero. Recruitment error is given by a multivariate normal distribution reflecting the recruitment covariance among CUs. 

\begin{align}
  S_{y<=6,i} &= \frac{\alpha_{i}}{\beta_{i}} \\
  S_{y>6,i} &= RY_{y,i} \cdot (1- \overline{ER}_{n = Canada})
  (\#eq:Seqinit)
\end{align}


The age structure of the population is then calculated based on the mean age structure for each CU given by the user and random variability following a multivariate logistic error structure (@schnute_influence_1995). The age structure error can vary or be held constant among CUs. 


The following step is to compute recruitment following the recruitment curve specified by the user. For the LRP version of samSim, three versions of the recruitment curve are available: A simple Ricker curve (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersimple) with $\rho = 0$), Ricker curve with temporal autocorrelation in recruitment error (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersimple)), and Ricker curve with freshwater survival covariate (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersurv)). Recruitment error is assumed to be correlated among CUs for all versions of the Ricker curve. Random recruitment deviates can be generated with multivariate t or multivariate normal distributions, that can be symmetric or skewed. The study cases used in this report all assume that recruitment deviates come from a symmetrical multivariate normal distribution (Equation \@ref(eq:CUautocorr)). 

\begin{align}
  R_{y,i} &= S_{y,i} \cdot e^{\alpha{i} - \beta{i} \cdot S_{y,i} + w_{y,i} - \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2}}\\
  w_{y=1,i} &= 0 * \rho + v_{y,i} \\
  w_{y>1,i} &= w_{y-1,i} * \rho + v_{y,i} 
  (\#eq:Rickersimple)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  v_{y,i} \sim N(\mu=0,covMat)
  (\#eq:CUautocorr)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
  Ra_{y,i,j} &= ppn_{j} \cdot S \cdot e^{\alpha{i} - \beta{i} \cdot S + \gamma_{i} \cdot Surv_{y,j} + v_{y,i} - \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2}}\\
  R_{y,i} &= \sum^{j}Ra_{y,i,j}
  (\#eq:Rickersurv)
\end{align}


For the Ricker model with the survival covariate, the covariates for each calendar year are generated following a normal distribution with user defined mean and variance (Equation \@ref(eq:survCY)). The distribution of survival covariates is truncated between maximum and minimum values provided by the user.  The brood year survival covariates, $Surv_{y,j}$, are currently populated following the dominant life history types from Interior Fraser Coho. For that stock, fish with a 3-year life cycle differ from those with a 4-year life cycle in the number of years spent in freshwater as juveniles, i.e., 18 months vs 30 months; both life cycles spend 18 months at sea before returning to spawn. Fish with a 2-year life cycle spend 18 months in the freshwater environment and only 6 months at sea before returning as jacks. This life history results in the survival covariate being lagged by one year for ages 2 and 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:cohosurvivaldiagram) and Equation \@ref(eq:surv)). The exception is the first two years of the priming loop, when no lag is applied to the covariates.
 
\begin{align}
  SurvCY_{y} &= wSurv_{y} - \frac{{\sigma_{Surv}}^2}{2}\\
  wSurv_{y} &\sim N(\mu_{Surv},\sigma_{Surv})
  (\#eq:survCY)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
Surv_{y,j} = 
\begin{cases}
 SurvCY_{y-1} & \text{if } j\leq 3 \\
 SurvCY_{y} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
 (\#eq:surv)
\end{align}



```{r cohosurvivaldiagram, fig.cap="Diagram of Interior Fraser coho dominant life history, gray indicates freshwater stages and blue indicates marine stage. brood year is marked in the rows and delays in the survival covariate are marked in the columns", warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/cohofreshwatersurvivaldiagram.png')
```


Recruitment estimates produced for either formulation of the Ricker model are capped. The default cap is  $3 \cdot S_{eq}$, but the scalar can be modified by the user via the $RSc$ variable (Equation \@ref(eq:reccapscalar)). In addition, if the generated recruitment is lower than the user defined extinction threshold, then Recruitment is set to zero.  

\begin{align}
  S_{eq} &= \alpha_{i}/\beta_{i}\\
  R_{y,i} &= min(R_{y,i}, RSc \cdot S_{eq})
  (\#eq:reccapscalar)
\end{align}

#### Compute management benchmarks

In the priming loop, the management benchmarks are only calculated in the last two generations, i.e. if $y<nPrime-2*gen$. The management benchmarks are calculated according to three options: "stockRecruit", "percentile" and "habitat". For all three options, lower and upper benchmarks are calculated. All management benchmarks are denoted with the time index, $y$, because samSim has the capability of estimating management benchmarks on a yearly basis, relying on the data obtained from the beginning of the time series to the current simulation year. However for the purpose of the LRP study cases, time invariant management benchmarks were used. <-- based on the priming? phase need to check

 If the "stockRecruit" option is used with the Ricker recruitment functions, then the lower benchmark is set to  $Sgen_{y,i}$ and the upper benchmark is set to 80\% of $Smsy_{y,i}$. When the model with the survival covariate is used, the $\alpha$ parameter is modified to incorporate the survival component (Equation \@ref(eq:alphamb)). In order to keep the management benchmarks constant through time, the long term average of  the survival covariate,  $\mu_{Surv}$, is used. $Smsy_{y,i}$ is calculated following the explicit solution provided by @scheuerell_explicit_2016 using the Lambert W function (Equation  \@ref(eq:smsysamsim)). $Sgen_{y,i}$ is estimated by solving Equation \@ref(eq:Sgensamsim) numerically, as described by @holt_indicators_2009. 


\begin{align}
{\alpha_{i}}^\prime &=
\begin{cases}
 \alpha_{i} + \gamma_{i}\cdot \mu_{Surv} & \text{for Ricker with survival} \\
\alpha_{i}  & \text{for simple Ricker}
\end{cases}  
  (\#eq:alphamb)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  Smsy_{y,i} &= (1 - W(e^{1-{\alpha_{y,i}}^\prime}))/\beta_{i}
  (\#eq:smsysamsim)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
  Smsy_{y,i} &= Sgen_{y,i} \cdot e^{\alpha_{y, i}\cdot (1-Sgen_{y,i}/\beta_{i})} 
  (\#eq:Sgensamsim)
\end{align}

If the "percentile" benchmark option is chosen, the upper benchmark is set to the 50th percentile of the historical Spawners ($S_{1:y,i}$). The lower benchmark is set to the 25th percentile $S_{1:y,i}$. If the "habitat" benchmark option is used, the same benchmarks in the "stockRecruit" option is used. The difference is in the origin of the stock recruit parameters, i.e., from the habitat model instead of spawner-recruitment curve.
Need to specify upper and lowe benchmarks here

#### Infilling and Observation model

The last step of  the model priming is infilling, which is only relevant if stock recruitment data is available and there are gaps in the last 12 years of the time series. Any gaps in the last 12 years of the Spawners and Recruits time series are infilled with a geometric mean of the entire priming period.

In the priming phase, all observations are set equal to the true simulation values, i.e., no observation error is added. 


### Model Projections

The model projection phase is used to represent future potential outcomes. The steps in this phase will depend on the scenarios and management procedures are implemented selected by the user, and therefore will vary depending on the model application. In this report, we list all steps in the order they appear in the code and indicate in the text if the step was used for the LRP case studies. The following description follows the order of the code implementation, therefore the subheadings in this section could be seen as pseudo code. The projections run for each trial from year `nPrime + 1` to `nYears`, the latter being the number of projection years defined by the user. 



#### Specify Stock recruitment parameters

Similarly to the priming phase, the first step on the projection loop is to define the stock recruitment parameters. The $\beta$ and $\sigma$ parameters are considered fixed and were already defined in the priming phase. However, if the user specifies productivity changes through time, then the productivity parameter $\alpha{y,i}$ is adjusted every year following a linear trend. A detailed description of the algorithm used to generate productivity trends is out of the scope of this report as the study cases do not include scenarios with productivity changes. As the productivity parameter is held constant in the study cases, we will continue to use the time-invariant notation ($\alpha_{i}$) for the parameter in the sections to follow. 

#### Specify Management benchmarks

Once $\alpha_{i}$ is specified, the true management quantities $Smsy_{y,i}$ and $Sgen_{y,i}$ for the projection year are computed following Equations \@ref(eq:smsysamsim) and \@ref(eq:Sgensamsim). The management benchmarks can be re-estimated every year or set by the normative period, i.e., last year of the priming phase, `nPrime`. The study cases in this report use the normative period management benchmarks. 
 
#### Observation submodel - returns at age

In this step, observation error is added to the proportion of returns at age for each brood year. The observation error for the proportions at age is given by a multivariate logistic error structure as described by @schnute_influence_1995. Observation error for the proportions of returns at age is not included in the study cases described in this report. 

<!--
 It seems that the age composition error is added again at each round of the loop, i.e. for each y, obsS[y-5:y-1,] is overwritten. If that is true, the observed returns for the past five years change every year? Am I am misunderstanding/missing something? -- need to run the code and verify if this is true.
\begin{align}
  obsppn_{y,i,j} \sim MVlogis(ppn_{y,i,j}, \tau) 
  (\#eq:obsppn)
\end{align}


-->

The observed recruitment by brood year is retrieved by multiplying the true recruitment at age for each calendar year by the vector of observed proportions at age in the returns (Equation \@ref(eq:obsR)). 



\begin{align}
  obsR_{y,i} &= \sum^j (RY_{y+j,i} \cdot obsppn_{y+j,i,j})
  (\#eq:obsR)
\end{align}



#### Management submodel

In this step, the population forecast, total allowable catch, realized catches are calculated. Forecast error is not considered in the study cases covered in this report. When forecast error is included in the projection scenarios, it is generated with lognormal error. True calendar year recruitment is multiplied by a random variable generated following a lognormal distribution with mean and variance specified by the user (Equations \@ref(eq:FctR) and \@ref(eq:Fct)). The distribution is also truncated between the 0.0001 and 0.9999 quantiles to avoid extreme forecast values.

\begin{align}
  fRY_{y,i} &= RY_{y,i} \cdot \omega_{y,i}
  (\#eq:FctR)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \omega_{y,i} \sim logN(\mu_{\omega},\sigma_{\omega},)
  (\#eq:Fct)
\end{align}

The recruitment forecast and true recruitment are then aggregated at the management unit level (Equation \@ref(eq:MUagg)) and 

\begin{align}
  aggRY_{y} &= \sum^{i} RY_{y,i}\\
  aggfRY_{y} &= \sum^{i} fRY_{y,i}
  (\#eq:MUagg)
\end{align}

The next step is to calculate the allowable catch following a harvest control rule. Both study cases in this report use the fixed exploitation rate harvest control rule. In this option, the allowable catch is the product of fixed exploitation rates and calendar year recruits (Equation  \@ref(eq:tac)). The baseline fixed exploitation rates for Canada and the USA are defined in the input files. Currently, only Canadian exploitation rates have added variability implemented through draws from beta distributions (Equation \@ref(eq:ER) and \@ref(eq:CanER)). Two layers of variability are considered:  error with common mean and CVs for all CUs and error with CU-specific CVs. In the first layer, an exploitation rate value is drawn from a beta distribution with mean and CV defined by the user. In the second layer, CU-specific exploitation rates are drawn from a beta distribution using the output exploitation rate from the first layer as mean and CU-specific CV defined in the input files. The mean and CVs are transformed into shape and location parameters for the beta distribution draws (Equations \@ref(eq:ouERCU1)-\@ref(eq:ouERCU) and \@ref(eq:deER1)-\@ref(eq:deER)).

 
\begin{align}
  tTAC_{i,n} &= tER_{i,n} \cdot aggRY_{y}
  (\#eq:tac)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
tER_{i,n} &
\begin{cases}
 \sim Beta(o_{i},u_{i}) & \text{n=Canada} \\
 =\theta_{n}  & \text{n=U.S.}
\end{cases}  
  (\#eq:ER)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
(\#eq:ouERCU1)
   o_{i} &= ERagg_{y,n}^2 \cdot (\frac{1-ERagg_{y,n}}{\varphi_{i}^{2}}-\frac{1}{ERagg_{y,n}})\\
   u_{i} &= v \cdot \frac{1}{ERagg_{y,n}-1}\\
   \varphi_{i} &= \phi_{i} \cdot ERagg_{y,n}
   (\#eq:ouERCU)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
ERagg_{y,n}  \sim Beta(d,e) 
  (\#eq:CanER)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
(\#eq:deER1)
   d &= {\bar{ER}_{n}}^2 \cdot (\frac{1-\bar{ER}_{n}}{\vartheta^{2}}-\frac{1}{\bar{ER}_{n}})\\
   e &= d \cdot \frac{1}{\bar{ER}_{n}-1}\\ 
   \vartheta &= CV_{\theta} \cdot \theta_{n}  
  (\#eq:deER)
\end{align}


The TAC for Canada is further divided in two components, mixed stock fishery and single stock fisheries (Equations \@ref(eq:tacmix) and \@ref(eq:tacsingle)). Once all TACs are calculated, the temporary value $tTAC_{y,i,n}$ is adjusted to CU-specific abundances (Equations \@ref(eq:cuppn) - \@ref(eq:tacadj)).



\begin{align}
(\#eq:tacmix)
  tmixTAC_{y,i} &=  tTAC_{y,i,n=Can} \cdot \psi_{y,i} \\
  tsingleTAC_{y,i} &= tTAC_{y,i,n=Can} \cdot (1- \psi)
  (\#eq:tacsingle)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
(\#eq:cuppn)
  pCU_{y,i} &= RY_{y,i}/ \sum^{i}RY_{y,i}\\
  TAC_{y,i,n} &= tTAC_{y,i,n} \cdot pCU_{y,i}\\
  mixTAC_{y,i} &= tmixTAC_{y,i}  \cdot pCU_{y,i}\\
  singleTAC_{y,i} &=  tsingleTAC_{y,i} \cdot pCU_{y,i}
  (\#eq:tacadj)
\end{align}





Once the allowable catches are defined, the realized catches are computed. The realized catches include an additional layer of uncertainty representing the implementation error. Catch uncertainty is often easier to parameterize using observed deviations in target and realized exploitation rates rather than catches. Therefore, the target total allowable catches are back-converted to exploitation rates \@ref(eq:muER) and realized catches are generated using beta distributed error around those exploitation rates. When computing the temporary exploitation rates, the catches are removed sequentially following the order U.S. fisheries, Canadian mixed stock, and Canadian single stock fishery \@ref(eq:muER). The LRP study cases only considered mixed stock fisheries, therefore the catches for the two other categories were set to zero. 

\begin{align}
\zeta_{i} &=
\begin{cases}
 \frac{TAC_{y,i,n=U.S}}{RY_{y,i}} & \text{n=U.S.} \\
 \frac{mixTAC_{y,i}}{RY_{y,i}-TAC_{y,i,n=U.S.}} & \text{n=U.S.} \\
 \frac{singleTAC_{y,i}}{RY_{y,i}-TAC_{y,i,n=U.S.}-mixTAC_{y,i}} & \text{n=U.S.} \\
\end{cases} 
  (\#eq:muER)
\end{align}

<!--

\begin{align}
  C_{y,i} &= tER_{i} \cdot RY_{y,i} \\
  tER_{i} &\sim Beta(l_{i},s_{i})\\
  l_{i} &=  {\zeta_{i}}^2 \cdot (\frac{1 - \zeta_{i}}{\sigma_C^2} - \frac{1}{\zeta_{i}})\\
  s_{i} &= l_{i} \cdot \frac{1}{\zeta_{i} - 1}
  (\#eq:realcatch)
\end{align}


The next step is to compute the number of Spawners and exploitation rate (Equations \@ref(eq:spawners) and \@ref(eq:ER))


\begin{align}
  (\#eq:spawners)
  S_{y,i} &= RY_{y,i} \cdot(1-ER_{y,i}) \\
  ER_{y,i} &= \frac{\sum^n TAC_{y,i,n}}{RY_{y,i}}
  (\#eq:ER)
\end{align}


  -->

#### Current year Observation submodel 

In this step, observation error is added to the quantities calculated in the current time step. Catch observation error is given by a log normal distribution truncated between the 0.0001, 0.9999 quantiles. If the catch is taken in a mixed stock fishery, an additional multivariate logistic error is incorporated to account for uncertainty in the stock assignment process. Observed Spawner is given by a log normal distribution truncated between the 0.0001, 0.9999 quantiles.


\begin{align}
  obsC_{y,i,n} &= C_{y,i,n} \cdot o_{y,i,n}\\
  o_{y,i,n} \sim logN(0,\sigma_{C})
  (\#eq:obsC)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  obsS_{y,i} &= S_{y,i} \cdot  \cdot u_{y,i,n}\\
  u_{y,i,n} \sim logN(0,\sigma_{S})
  (\#eq:obsS)
\end{align}

Observed recruitment is set to the sum of observed spawners and catches
\begin{align}
  obsRY_{y,i} &= \sum^{n}obsC_{y,i,n} + obsS_{y,i}\\
  obsER_{y,i} &= \frac{\sum^{n}obsC_{y,i,n}}{obsRY_{y,i}}
  (\#eq:obsRY)
\end{align}


#### Assessment submodel

This next phase of the projecton loop simulates salmon stock assessment analysis. The linearized simple Ricker stock recruit curve is fit to the observed data and $\hat{a_{y,i}}$ and $\hat{b_{y,i}}$ are estimated.

\begin{align}
  obslogRS_{1:y,i} &= \hat{a_{y,i}}-\hat{b_{y,i}} \cdot  obsS_{y,i}\\
  (\#eq:obslogRS)
\end{align}

At this point, the management benchmarks could be re-estimated based on the simulated observed data and estimated parameters, using the same procedure described in section \@ref(management-benchmarks). The LRP study cases, however, set the management benchmarks to the normative period, and for this reason the management benchmarks are kept constant and equal to the management benchmark at the last year of the priming period.

If the stock recruitment management benchmarks cannot be estimated, they are set to the previous estimated value. 

Make a note that the habitat benchmarks are not defined here. 
-->


#### Population Dynamics submodel again


The final step in the projection loop is to project the brood year recruitment for the current year. The first step is to generate the marine survival estimates which are used to project recruitment when the Ricker model with survival covariates is used. The survival covariates are generated using the method described in Section \@ref(Recruitment-data-is-not-available) and Equations \@ref(eq:survCY) and \@ref(eq:surv). Marine survival covariates are considered to be constant across CUs.

The following step is compute the age structure variability, which follows the same procedure described in Section \@ref(Recruitment-data-is-not-available), based on the mean age structure for each CU given by the user and random variability following a multivariate logistic error structure.

Once the age structure variability is calculated is time to calculate the recruitment deviations, given by a multivariate normal distribution reflecting the recruitment covariance among CUs. Recruitment is then calculated following the Equations \@ref(eq:Rickersimple) and \@ref(eq:Rickersurv). Following the computation of $R_{y,i}$, Samsim checks if checks whether a population has gone quasi-extinct, i.e. if Spawner abundances were below the extinction threshold for one generation.  

The last step of the projection loop is to recort true and observed upper and lower management benchmarks. These are computed based on the true and observed spawner abundaces. The specific benchmarks calculations will depend on the user choice, as described in Section \@ref(compute-management-benchmarks).
