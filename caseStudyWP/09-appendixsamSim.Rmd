# SamSim MODEL DOCUMENTATION {#app:third-appendix}

SamSim is the closed loop simulation model used for calculation of the projection based LRPs. A model overview and the code can be found in project [github page](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP). This appendix describes the model equations relevant to the Interior Fraser coho salmon and West coast Vancouver Island Chinook salmon study cases. The simulation model has two main phases: Model Priming and Projections. The model priming phase recreates data for past years, either by populating objects with observed data or by generating data based on input parameters. The projection phase generates data for future years based on the user defined scenarios and management procedures.  Four primary time-series are populated in this simulation model: Spawners $S_{y,k}$, Recruitment $R_{y,k}$, Catch $C_{y,k,i}$ and exploitation rate $ER_{y,k,i}$. The model indexes and quantities are defined in Table \@ref(tab:modvar) and input parameters used for the study cases are listed in Table \@ref(tab:parval). Detailed definitions of the input data and parameters are provided in the project [README](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP#readme).

The following sections in this appendix are organized similarly to the samSim code, that way the subheadings can be read as pseudo code.  


### Model Priming


The priming phase, or model initialization, represents the past data for CUs being modeled. It is used to represent real and observed abundances before starting the projection trials. This phase loops over a number of past years ('nPrime') and reconstructs recruitment time series for past years. The simulations can be initialized in two ways: with existing recruitment data or with user defined parameters, if recruitment data is not available.  

#### If Recruitment Data is available

If spawner-recruitment data is available, the number of initialization years 'nPrime' is defined based on the length of the longest CU time series available. The Spawners, Recruits, Catch and Exploitation Rate objects are populated with the input data. If catch and/or exploitation rate data are not available, those values are set to zero.


#### If Recruitment Data is not available



When Recruitment data is not available, the 'nPrime' is set to 10 times the maximum age of recruits. Because the stock recruitment data is not available, the first step on this routine is to retrieve the stock recruitment parameters. The user has the option of providing either fixed values or a set of mcmc samples. If mcmc samples are provided, one set of parameters is used for each simulation trial.

The next step in the simulation is to adjust the spawner recruitment parameters according to the user defined scenarios. samSim includes options to adjust the recruitment standard deviations, $\sigma_{k}$,  and the productivity parameter, $\alpha_{k}$. The LRP case studies do not include adjustments or changes in productivity over time, therefore we will not describe the productivity adjustments in this report. 

Recruitment is assumed to be correlated between the CU's, the correlation matrix is calculated based on the $\sigma_{k}$ parameters, and the correlation among CUs in recruitment deviations specified by the user.   
 

Once parameters are defined the number of spawners, $S_{y,k}$, is initialized. When no recruitment data is provided, $S_{y,k}$ is set at equilibrium for the first 6 years and then calculated based on recruitment  and exploitation rates in the previous years (equation \@ref(eq:Seqinit)). If the calculated number of spawners is lower than the user inputted extinction threshold, then the number of spawners is set o zero. Recruitment error is given by a multivariate normal disribution reflecting the recruitment covariance among CUs. 

\begin{align}
  S_{y<=6,k} &= \frac{\alpha_{k}}{\beta_{k}} \\
  S_{y>6,k} &= RY_{y,k} \cdot (1- ER_{y,k})
  (\#eq:Seqinit)
\end{align}


The age structure of the population is then calculated based on the mean age structure for each CU given by the user and random variability following a multivariate logistic error structure (@schnute_influence_1995). The age structure error can vary or be held constant among CUs. 


The following step is to compute recruitment following the recruitment curve specified by the user. For the LRP version of samSim, three versions of the recruitment curve are available: A simple Ricker curve (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersimple) with $\rho = 0$), Ricker curve with temporal autocorrelation in recruitment error (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersimple)), and Ricker curve with freshwater survival covariate (equation \@ref(eq:Rickersurv)). Recruitment error is assumed to be correlated among CUs for all versions of the Ricker curve. Random recruitment deviates can be generated with multivariate t or multivariate normal distributions, that can be symmetric or skewed. The study cases used in this report all assume that recruitment deviates come from a symmetrical multivariate normal distribution (equation \@ref(eq:CUautocorr)). 

\begin{align}
  R_{y,k} &= S_{y,k} \cdot e^{\alpha{k} - \beta{k} \cdot S_{y,k} + w_{y,k} - \frac{\sigma_{k}^{2}}{2}}\\
  w_{y=1,k} &= 0 * \rho + v_{y,k} \\
  w_{y>1,k} &= w_{y-1,k} * \rho + v_{y,k} 
  (\#eq:Rickersimple)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  Ra_{y,k,j} &= ppn_{j} \cdot S \cdot e^{\alpha{k} - \beta{k} \cdot S + \gamma_{k} \cdot Surv_{y,j} + v_{y,k} - \frac{\sigma_{k}^{2}}{2}}\\
  R_{y,k} &= \sum^{j}Ra_{y,k,j}
  (\#eq:Rickersurv)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  v_{y,k} \sim N(\mu=0,covMat)
  (\#eq:CUautocorr)
\end{align}


For the Ricker model with the survival covariate, the covariates for each calendar year are generated following a normal distribution with user defined mean and variance (Equation \@ref(eq:survCY)). The distribution of survival covariates is truncated between maximum and minimum values provided by the user.  The brood year survival covariates, $Surv_{y,j}$, are currently populated following the dominant life history types from Interior Fraser Coho. For that stock, fish with a 3-year life cycle differ from those with a 4-year life cycle in the number of years spent in freshwater as juveniles, i.e., 18 months vs 30 months; both life cycles spend 18 months at sea before returning to spawn. Fish with a 2-year life cycle spend 18 months in the freshwater environment and only 6 months at sea before returning as jacks. This life history results in the survival covariate being lagged by one year for ages 2 and 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:cohosurvivaldiagram) and Equation \@ref(eq:surv)). The exception is the first two years of the priming loop, when no lag is applied to the covariates.
 
\begin{align}
  SurvCY_{y} = wSurv_{y} - \frac{{\sigma_{Surv}}^2}{2})
  wSurv_{y} &\sim N(\mu_{Surv},\sigma_{Surv})
  (\#eq:survCY)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
Surv_{y,j} = 
\begin{cases}
 SurvCY_{y-1} & \text{if } j\leq 3 \\
 SurvCY_{y} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
 (\#eq:surv)
\end{align}



```{r cohosurvivaldiagram, fig.cap="Diagram of Interior Fraser coho dominant life history, gray indicates freshwater stages and blue indicates marine stage. brood year is marked in the rows and delays in the survival covariate are marked in the columns", warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/cohofreshwatersurvivaldiagram.png')
```


Recruitment estimates produced for either formulation of the Ricker model are capped. The default cap is  $3 \cdot S_{eq}$, but the scalar can be modified by the user via the $RSc$ variable (Equation \@ref(eq:reccapscalar)). In addition, if the generated recruitment is lower than the user defined extinction threshold, then Recruitment is set to zero.  

\begin{align}
  S_{eq} &= \alpha_{k}/\beta_{k}\\
  R_{y,k} &= min(R_{y,k}, RSc \cdot S_{eq})
  (\#eq:reccapscalar)
\end{align}

#### Management benchmarks

In the priming loop, the management benchmarks are only calculated in the last two generations, i.e. if $y<nPrime-2*gen$. The management benchmarks are calculated according to three options: "stockRecruit", "percentile" and "habitat". For all three options, lower and upper benchmarks are calculated.

 If the "stockRecruit" option is used with the Ricker recruitment functions, then the lower benchmark is set to  $Sgen_{k}$ and the upper benchmark is set to 80\% of $Smsy_{k}$. When the model with the survival covariate is used, the $\alpha$ parameter is modified to incorporate the survival component (Equation \@ref(eq:alphamb)). In order to keep the management benchmarks constant through time, the long term average of  the survival covariate,  $\mu_{Surv}$, is used. $Smsy_{k}$ is calculated following the explicit solution provided by @scheuerell_explicit_2016 using the Lambert W function (Equation  \@ref(eq:smsy)). $S_{gen}$ is estimated by solving Equation \@ref(eq:Sgen) numerically, as described by @holt_indicators_2009. 


\begin{align}
{\alpha_{k}}^\prime &=
\begin{cases}
 \alpha_{k} + \gamma_{k}\cdot \mu_{Surv} & \text{for Ricker with survival} \\
\alpha_{k}  & \text{for simple Ricker}
\end{cases}  
  (\#eq:alphamb)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  Smsy_{y,k} &= (1 - W(e^{1-{\alpha_{y,k}}^\prime}))/\beta_{k}
  (\#eq:smsy)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
  Smsy_{y,k} &= Sgen_{k} \cdot e^{\alpha_{y, k}\cdot (1-Sgen_{gen}/\beta_{k})} 
  (\#eq:Sgen)
\end{align}

If the "percentile" benchmark option is chosen, the upper benchmark is set to the 50th percentile of the historical Spawners ($S_{1:y,k}$). The lower benchmark is set to the 25th percentile $S_{1:y,k}$. If the "habitat" benchmark option is used, the same benchmarks in the "stockRecruit" option is used. The difference is in the origin of the stock recruit parameters, i.e., from the habitat model instead of spawner-recruitment curve.

#### Infilling and Observation model

The last step of  the model priming is infilling, which is only relevant if stock recruitment data is available and there are gaps in the last 12 years of the time series. Any gaps in the last 12 years of the Spawners and Recruits time series are infilled with a geometric mean of the entire priming period.

In the priming phase, all observations are set equal to the true simulation values, i.e., no observation error is added. 


### Model Projections

The model projection phase is used to represent future potential outcomes. It is the phase where all scenarios and management procedures are implemented. The following description follows the order of the code implementation, therefore the subheadings in this section could be seen as pseudo code. The projections run for each trial from year `nPrime + 1` to `nYears`, the latter being the number of projection years defined by the user. 

#### Population Dynamics submodel

##### Specify alpha

Similarly to the priming phase, the first step on the projection loop is to define time varying productivity stock recruitment parameter $\alpha{y.k}$. If the user specify that productivity should change through time, then the productivity for each CU is adjusted every year by applying a linear trend to the alpha value. A detailed description of the algorithm used to generate productivity trends is out of the scope of this report as the study cases do not include scenarios with productivity changes. As the productivity parameter is held constant throughout the projections, we will continue to use the time-invariant notation ($\alpha_{k}$) for the parameter in the sections to follow. 

##### Specify Management benchmarks

Once $\alpha_{k}$ is specified, the management quantities $Smsy_{y,k}$ and $Sgen_{y,k}$ for the projection year are computed following Equations \@ref(eq:smsy) and \@ref(eq:Sgen). The management benchmarks can be re-estimated every year or set by the normative period, i.e., last year of the priming phase, `nPrime`. The study cases in this report use the normative period management benchmarks. 
 
#### Observation submodel - previous years of abundance

In this step, observation error is added to the proportion of returns at age for each brood year. The observation error for the proportions at age is given by a multivariate logistic error structure as described by @schnute_influence_1995. Observation error for the proportions of returns at age is not considered in the study cases described in this report. 

<!--
 It seems that the age composition error is added again at each round of the loop, i.e. for each y, obsS[y-5:y-1,] is overwritten. If that is true, the observed returns for the past five years change every year? Am I am misunderstanding/missing something? -- need to run the code and verify if this is true.
\begin{align}
  obsppn_{y,k,j} \sim MVlogis(ppn_{y,k,j}, \tau) 
  (\#eq:obsppn)
\end{align}


-->

The observed recruitment by brood year is then retrieved by multiplying the true recruitment at age for each calendar year by the vector of observed proportions at age in the returns (Equation \@ref(eq:obsR)). 



\begin{align}
  obsR_{y,k} &= \sum^j RY_{y+j,k} \cdot obsppn_{y+j,k,j}
  (\#eq:obsR)
\end{align}



#### Management submodel

In this step, the population forecast and benchmarks are calculated. Forecast error is calculated via a scaler that is generated following a lognormal distribution with mean and variance specified by the user (Equations \@ref(eq:FctR) and \@ref(eq:Fct)). The distribution is also truncated between the 0.0001 and 0.9999 quantiles to avoid extremes . 

\begin{align}
  FctRY_{y,k} &= RY_{y,k} \cdot Fct{y,k}
  (\#eq:FctR)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  Fct_{y,k} \sim logN(\mu_{Fct},\sigma_{Fct},)
  (\#eq:Fct)
\end{align}

The recruitment forecast and true recruitment are then aggregated at the management unit level (Equation \@ref(eq:MUagg)) and 

\begin{align}
  RYMU_{y,MU} &= \sum^{k \in MU} RY_{y,k}\\
  FctRYMU_{y,MU} &= \sum^{k \in MU} FctRY_{y,k}
  (\#eq:MUagg)
\end{align}

The next step is to calculate the allowable catch following a harvest control rule. Both study cases in this report  use the `fixedER` option for the harvest control rule. In this option, the user defines fixed exploitation rates for Canada an the USA. Random variability following the beta distribution is applied to the Canadian exploitation rates in two ways: an annual deviation in overall ER and a CU-specific deviation from that annual overall exploitation rate can vary or be constant over time

\begin{align}
  TAC_{y,k,i} &= ER_{y,k,i} \cdot RYMU_{y,MU}
  (\#eq:tac)
\end{align}




\begin{align}
   CanER_{y,k} &\sim beta(shape_d,shape_e)\\ 
   shape_d &= CanERSMU_{y,k}^2 \cdot (\frac{1-CanERSMU_{y,k}}{\sigma_{canER}^{2}}-\frac{1}{CanERSMU_{y,k}})\\
   shape_e &= shape_d \cdot \frac{1}{CanERSMU_{y,k}-1}\\
   \sigma_{canER}&=CVER \cdot CanERSMU_{y,k}
  (\#eq:CanER)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
   CanERSMU_{y,k} &\sim beta(shape_a,shape_b)\\ 
   shape_a &= fixcanER^2 \cdot(\frac{1-fixcanER}{\sigma_{canERSMU}^{2}}-\frac{1}{fixcanER})\\
   shape_b &= shape_a \cdot \frac{1}{fixcanER-1}\\
   \sigma_{canERSMU} &= CVERSMU \cdot fixcanER
  (\#eq:CanERSMU)
\end{align}

Finally, the CU specific TACs are calculated by multiplying the SMU  


\begin{align}
  cuppn &= RY_{y,k}/ RYMU_{y,k}
  CanTAC_{y,k} &= CanTAC_{y,k} \cdot cuppn_{y,k}\\  
  (\#eq:tac)
\end{align}

<!--
need to describe everything above into amTAC, Can mixTAC and cansingtac, need to figure out the dimensions of the catch
-->

Once the allowable catches are defined, the realized catches are computed. Catch  uncertainty is often easier to parameterize using observed deviations in target and realized exploitation rates rather than catches. Therefore, the target total allowable catches are back-converted to exploitation rates and realized catches are generated using  beta distributed error around the exploitation rates. 

\begin{align}
  Catch_{y,k} &= tempER * RY_{y,k} \\
  tempER &\sim Beta(location_{k},shape_{k})\\
  location_{k} &=  {TAC_{y,k}}^2 \cdot (\frac{1 - mu}{\sigma_TAC^2} - \frac{1}{TAC_{y,k}})\\
  shape_{k} &= location_{k} \cdot \frac{1}{TAC_{y,k} - 1}
  (\#eq:realcatch)
\end{align}

The final step of this phase is to compute the Spawners and the exploitation rate Equations \@ref(eq:spawners)

\begin{align}
  S_{y,k} &= RY_{y,k} \cdot(1-ER_{y,k}) \\
  ER_{y,k} &= \frac{\sum^i TAC_{y,k,i}}{RY_{y,k}}
  (\#eq:spawners)
\end{align}

#### Second Observation submodel -current year

In this step, observation error is added to the quantities calcualted in the current time step. Catch observation error is given by a log normal distribution truncated between the 0.0001, 0.9999 quantiles. If the catch is taken in a mixed stock fishery, an additional multivariate logistic error is incorporated to
account for uncertainty in the stock assignment process. Spawners observation error is also given by a log normal distribution truncated between the 0.0001, 0.9999 quantiles.


\begin{align}
  obsC_{y,k,i} &= C_{y,k,i} \cdot o_{y,k,i}\\
  o_{y,k,i} \sim logN(0,\sigma_{C},0.0001,0.9999)
  (\#eq:obsC)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  obsS_{y,k} &= S_{y,k} \cdot  \cdot u_{y,k,i}\\
  u_{y,k,i} \sim logN(0,\sigma_{S},0.0001,0.9999)
  (\#eq:obsS)
\end{align}

Observed recruitment is set to the sum of observed spawners and catches
\begin{align}
  obsRY_{y,k} &= \sum^{i}C_{y,k,i} + obsS_{y,k}\\
  obsER_{y,k} &= \frac{\sum^{i}C_{y,k,i}}{obsRY_{y,k}}
  (\#eq:obsR)
\end{align}


#### Assessment submodel

This next phase of the projecton loop simulates salmon stock assessment analysis. The linearized simple Ricker stock recruit curve is fit to the observed data.

\begin{align}
  obslogRS_{1:y,k} &= esta_{y,k}-estb_{y,k} \cdot  obsS_{y,k}\\
  (\#eq:obsR)
\end{align}

Management benchmarks are then estimated 

describe percentiles true and observed

Describe SR obs BM
same as prime loop but with observed qquantities

If the stock recruitment management benchmarks cannot be estimated, they are set to the previous estimated value. 

Make a note that the habitat benchmarks are not defined here.
