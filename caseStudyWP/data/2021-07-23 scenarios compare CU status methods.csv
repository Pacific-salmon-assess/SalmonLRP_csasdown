Scenario,CU status method,Data used,Number of CUs,Priority,Question to answer,Why?,Note,
1,Percentile,"no CU infilled CUs (no Upper Knight or Bute Inlet), no Bute Inlet or SCC (NA percentile benchmark)",4,1,How do percentile and decision tree compare?,Minimum best data,,
2,Percentile,"no CU-level infilled years*CUs, no Bute Inlet or SCC (NA percentile benchmark)",4 or 5 depending on year,1,Does SMU status change with more data?,Compare with scenario 2,,
3,Decision tree,"no CU infilled CUs  (no Upper Knight or Bute Inlet), no Bute Inlet or SCC (NA percentile benchmark)",4,1,How do percentile and decision tree compare?,"Minimum best data, compare with scenario 2 ",,
4,Decision tree,no CU infilled CUs (No Upper Knight or Bute Inlet),5,1,Does SMU status change with less/more data?,Compare with scenario 6,,
5,Decision tree,no CU-level infilled years*CUs ,"5, 6, or 7 depending on year",1,Does SMU status change with less/more data?,"Use as much data as possible that doesn't have CU infilling, compare with scenario 6, compare with scenario 2 which also uses all relevant data except infilling",Not sure how trend calculations deal with missing years of data - ask Gottfried,
6,Decision tree,"no CU-level infilled years*CUs, no Bute Inlet or SCC (NA percentile benchmark)",4 or 5 depending on year,2,How do perecntile and decision tree compare?,"Compare to scenario 2, use more data than scenario 5",Not sure how trend calculations deal with missing years of data - ask Gottfried,
