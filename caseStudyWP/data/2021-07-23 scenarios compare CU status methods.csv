4,Decision tree,4. Decision Tree-  5 CUs full ,no CU infilled CUs (No Upper Knight or Bute Inlet),5,1,Does LRP status change with more data?,Compare with scenario 6,
5,Decision tree,5. Decision Tree- 7 CUS partial,no CU-level infilled years*CUs ,"5, 6, or 7 depending on year",1,Does LRP status change with more data?,"Use as much data as possible that doesn't have CU infilling, compare with scenario 6, compare with scenario 2 which also uses all relevant data except infilling",
