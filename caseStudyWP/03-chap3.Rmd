# CASE STUDY 1: INTERIOR FRASER COHO SALMON

## CONTEXT

The Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes Coho Salmon that return to the Fraser River and tributaries upstream of Hell’s Gate in the Fraser Canyon. Declines in spawner abundance throughout the 1990’s led to a suite of management actions to promote recovery, including significant fishery restrictions (Decker et al. 2014). 

Five WSP Conservation Units (CUs) have been identified for of Interior Fraser Coho: Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, Lower Thompson, North Thompson, and South Thompson (DFO 2015; (Figure \@ref(fig:coho-map)). Interior Fraser Coho were assessed under the framework of DFO’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) in 2014, at which time the Integrated Status Assessment classified three of these CUs as being amber status (Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, South Thompson) and the remaining two CUs as amber/green status (Lower Thompson, North Thompson; DFO 2015).

```


Interior Fraser Coho have also been assessed twice by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC; COSEWIC 2002, 2016). The entire IF Coho SMU as classified as a single Designatable Unit (DU) by COWESIC in both of these assessments; however, a recent revision to DU classification has lead to 5 DUs that are closely aligned with the 5 CUs (citation available yet?). The most recent COSEWIC assessment classified the Interior Fraser Coho Designatable Unit (DU) as having “Threatened” status (COSEWIC 2016).

In response to the initial listing in 2002, DFO developed a conservation strategy for Interior Fraser Coho in xxxx (citation). The 

Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team




undertaken several recovery planning processes for Interior Fraser Coho.

In response to this listing, DFO undertook a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) for Interior Fraser Coho in 2018 that describes status, habitat, threats and limiting factors, candidate recovery targets, and abundance projections for the DU, as well as recommendations regarding mitigation and allowable harm (Arbeider et al. 2020). Our data and methods for calculating CU-level benchmarks borrow heavily from this recent RPA work.




## DATA

Data for this case study cover return years 1998 -2020. Data prior to 1998 were not used due to concerns about inconsistent assessment methods and data quality. All Interior Fraser Coho data were provided by DFO's Fraser River Stock Assessment Unit (M. Arbeider, pers. comm). These data included: (i) annual spawner abundance by CU (1998-2020; Figure \@ref(fig:coho-timeseries)), (ii) annual recruits-at-age by CU (brood years 1998 - 2016), (iii) a hatchery-based smolt-to-adult survival rate index, (iv) annual exploitation rates, and (v) annual spawner abundances for 11 sub-populations nested within the 5 CUs.

Data were similar to those previously described in Arbeider et al. 2020.  Detailed descriptions of data treatments, assumptions, infilling, and data quality are provided in Arbeider et al. (2020).More recent updates that are not described in Arbeider et al. (2020) include the incorporation of three additional years of data (return years 2018-2020), updates to the smolt-to-adult marine survival rate index to use a weighted average by release size, and increased data quality screening of scale ages used to calculate recruitment-at-age (M. Arbeider, pers. comm).

## METHODS


### CU Status Estimation


We consider two types of CU benchmark when developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs for Interior Fraser Coho. The first type is the WSP lower benchmark of Sgen, where Sgen is the number of spawners required to recover to SMSY (spawners maximum sustainable yield) within one generation, under equilibrium conditions in the absence of fishing (Holt et al. 2009).  Four different formulations of stock recruitment model are used to estimate Sgen based on previous analyses. Key differences among the formulations centre around whether a hierarchical model structure is used when estimating Sgen and whether an informative prior distribution is applied to the spawner abundance level at which the stock replaced itself (SRep).

  - more details on 4 SRR models (incl. equations)
  - show SR model fits


The second type is based on a short-term recovery target identified by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006), in which CU status is based on the distribution of spawning escapement among sub-populations nested within CUs (Table \@ref(tab:cohoCU2SP)). This benchmark is specific to the Interior Fraser Coho SMU. We have retained it as part of this case study to maintain consistency with previous work.




### LRP Estimation

#### Proportion of CUs > Sgen

#### Logistic Regression LRP

We evaluate two empirical (data-based) approaches for developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs for Interior Fraser Coho. Both approaches estimate LRPs by fitting logistic regression models to historically observed data; they differ in the metric used to represent CU-level status relative to CU-level lower benchmarks. 

The first approach uses a distributional benchmark to characterize CU status, which is based on the short-term recovery target identified by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006). The recovery target is that “the 3-year geometric average, natural-origin escapement in at least half of the subpopulations within each of the five CUs exceeds 1,000 spawning Coho Salmon, excluding hatchery fish spawning in the wild”. Based on this target, CU status in a given year is quantified as the proportion of sub-populations with escapement above 1000 fish. The “half of sub-populations within each CU” threshold required 2 out of 3 sub-populations to be above 1000 fish for the North Thompson and South Thompson CUs, 1 out of 2 sub-populations to be above 1000-fish for the Lower Thompson and Middle Fraser CU, and the only sub-population in the Fraser Canyon to be above 1000 fish to satisfy this target. CU-level status based on these distributional benchmarks then gets rolled-up into an SMU-level LRP using a logistic regression analysis described in section x above. 

- Still to add: 
  - threshold p*?


The second approach uses Sgen to characterize CU status.

  - proportional vs. probability-based logistic regression?  threshold p*?
  - logistic penalty used
