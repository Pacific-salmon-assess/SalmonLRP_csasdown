# LESSONS LEARNED FROM CASE STUDY APPLICATIONS

To be completed.

* Synthesize main results and conclusions from case studies

## Proportion-based LRPs

Different results will be produced depending on the methods used to estimate the Cu specific lower benchmarks. 
Even when abundance bases lower benchmarks are available i.e. Sgen, the choice of recryuitmen model being used will influence the resulting SMU status. (mention coho example)

Multi dimensional approach may be preferred as it incorporates multiple data sources, but results should be reviewed with expert input. 



## Aggregate abundance-based LRPs

### Logistic regression-based LRPs

Only estimable when there are years when all CUs or sub-populations are above their lower benchmark and years when at least one CU is below their lower benchmarks, i.e. there are both 0s and 1s in the SMU status time series. 

results depend on the lower benchmark used for determining the underlying CU status, which in turn will depend on data availability. 

Individual CU must have moderate to high level of covariation, -- compare Chum and coho estimates.

Model diagnostics and statistical testing of model assumptions will shed light on reiability of model estimates.  

### Projection based LRPs

- allows for consideration of structural uncertainty via consideration of alternative future scenarios. 
- Results depend on the level of exploitation rates assumed in future projections with higher exploitation rates resulting in higher aggregate abundance LRPs
- Need to review result of IFc to take a few points from there

Key points for ISC chum: 

For data poor stocks, data quality issues may limit the choice of CU-specific benchmarks used as basis for the calculation of the SMU LRP. For example, for the ISC chum study case,$Sgen$ could not be reliably estimated for all CUs, and its use lead to poor fits of the logistic aggregate abundance LRP (although fits were poor regardless of the benchmark used). For that study case, the analyses relied on the percentile-based benchmarks. 

The choice of benchmark to determine CU specific status will affect the classification and therefore will also affect the LRP. 

Percentile benchmarks were more conservative that multidimensional status, i.e. LRP was triggered more often when percentile benchmarks were used.  -- But I am not clear if this is a trend to be expected for other SMUs of if it's specific to ISC chum. 

Adding more CUs lead to LRP being triggered more often. -> this indicates that exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series may lead to more overly optimistic assessments. 

Aggregate abundance LRPs were not appropriate. Factors include: 
-different orders of magnitude in variation among CU
-lack of auto correlation in escapements
-wide range in productivity values between CUs 


WCVI Chinook main points: 

Carrie already wrote a great set of summary bullets by the end of that chapter. Maybe reinforce them here. 

Recommendation to exclude CUs and/or inlets with PNI <0.5 (maybe better considered in the guidelines, under the section on when maight be appropriate to consider less than 100% of CUs above LRP)

Proportion of CU above benchmarks indicate that SMU is below LRP because one specific CU is consistently below its lower benchmark. Aggregate abundance logistic regression-based LRPs are not estimable as there are no years in which the SMU is above LRP. 



Some ideas include:

- If data limitations arise in application of LRP to a stock, increased monitoring, data quality could be part of recovery plan/ trigger


IFC main points:

Retrospective analyses indicated that aggregate status estimates become unstable if two or more 
CUs are missing data.
