## CU-level benchmarks and assessments 
<!--## Proportion-based LRPs-->

<!--CH: I think the main point of this paragraph is that data on component CUs vary in quality and quantity. I've suggested some rewording--> 


<!--Proportion-based LRPs--> LRPs described in this working paper rely on CU-level benchmarks and assessments, for which data vary in quality and quantity. Our case studies demonstrate the application of proportion-based and aggregate-abundance based LRPs to SMUs containing CUs with a range of data availability including those with stock-recruitment based benchmarks, habitat-based benchmarks, and percentile-based benchmarks on spawner abundances. In addition, we demonstrate assessments for SMUs containing CUs without abundance-based benchmarks where statuses rely on short and long-term trends over time, as demonstrated in application of the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool to Inside Southcoast Chum - Non Fraser. 

At the CU-level, we found that using a single metric, spawner abundances relative to a WSP lower benchmark ($S_{gen}$ or percentiles) resulted in similar status assessments to using the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool. These similarities occur because when the lower benchmarks estimates are available, the rapid multidimensional scanning tool will almost always default to assessing status against them, as was demonstrated for all three case studies. Exceptions occur when the lower benchmark estimates are below the absolute population thresholds (e.g., below 1500 spawners) and available spawner time-series are absolute numbers, as occurred for the interior Fraser coho study case for 1 CU in 3 years<!--correct me I'm wrong on numbers here KH-->. In these cases, the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool triggered red status due to low abundances below the absolute conservation threshold even though the stock-recruitment based lower benchmark was not breached. 


In addition, we found that using the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool allows for the consideration of CUs that would otherwise be considered data deficient using single metric on spawner abundances relative to benchmarks, thus allowing for a more complete assessment of the SMU status. In these cases, the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool is able to provide an assessment of status based on short and long-term trends when benchmarks on spawner abundances are not available, as demonstrated in the Inside South Coast case study. 

<!--CH: this section needs to be informed by a discussion of CU-representativeness within each SMU (i.e., 4 criteria outlines in Ch 4 of Guidelines WP). My guess is that for WCVI CK, the threats are different enough that we could expect independent dynamics, e.g., not representative of each other, and this is likely the same for ISC chum. However, I'm not sure about IFR coho; the one v small CU might be considered independent of the others because it's so small, but the remaining 4 might be sufficiently similar to be representative?. 

The question is, do we think that data-rich CUs (or CUs included in analyses) are representative of data-limited CUs (or those excluded) such that their exclusion shouldn't matter, or do we think that data-rich CUs are NOT representative of data-limited CUs so we expect a difference in SMU-level status when we include/exclude the additional CUs?  This will affect how we frame this section; either further supporting the four 'representativeness' criteria from the Guidelines WP, or, more likely, suggesting caution even when those guidelines are implemented.-->


## SMU-level LRPs and assessments 

We found that removing component CUs from assessments of an SMU tended to increase variability in SMU-level status, which may be more pessimistic or optimistic than when all CUs are considered depending in part on the level of covariation among CUs. <!--CH: I suggest we broaden this pgh to refer to both ppn-based and aggregate-abudnance based LRPs. Kendra shows this point best for logistic-regression based LRPs, but not ppn-based LRPs. While Luke shows variability in whether LRP is breached among data sets, that section does not show variability in status (% of CUs above red) per se, like Kendra does. And I don't show it at all for WCVI CK--> If the LRP of 100% of CUs above red status has been breached for an SMU, the inclusion of additional CUs may further deplete or improve status (% of CUs above red), but will not increase status to above the LRP (100%). In contrast, if the LRP is not breached for an SMU, then the inclusion of additional CUs may deplete status to below the LRP or keep status at 100% of CUs above red zone. This asymmetrical impact of increased monitoring of CUs on SMU status may reduce incentives to extend monitoring to data-deficient CUs.<!--CH: Note to add this to Guidelines paper. This asymmetric property of both ppn-based and to a lesser extent these aggregate-abundance based LRPs is a characteristic we should highlight and cautious about; is a result of LRPs considering dynamics of component stocks that vary independently. -->

For SMUs with component CUs that vary independently of each other, the inclusion of additional CU-level assessments will increase the likelihood of the proportion-based LRP being breached. For example, for the Inside South Coast Chum case study, when data-limited CUs were included in the derivation of proportion-based LRPs (i.e., CUs without percentile-based benchmarks), the proportion-based LRP was breached more often in historical analyses compared to when those CUs were excluded. For this case study, the exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series led to overoptimistic assessments in some years compared to when those CUs were included. Our results from this case study highlight the importance of including data from all CUs when CUs show high variability in status estimates. Guidelines on identifying where data-rich CUs are more likely to provide status that is representative of data-deficient CUs and hence can be omitted from SMU-level LRPs and assessments is provided in Holt et al. (in review).


For both proportion-based and aggregate-abundance based LRPs, we found that status assessments were sensitive to assumptions about the structural form of the underlying spawner-recruitment model used to estimate the lower benchmark, $S_{gen}$, and to considerations of different types of lower benchmarks, e.g., those reflecting distribution of spawners as considered in the Interior Fraser River coho case study. The decision on which structural form or type of benchmarks to consider depends on the biological characteristics of the populations and available data, highlighting the importance of considering expert knowledge and peer-reviewed WSP assessments for determining CU status. This challenge of identifying the most appropriate model form is pervasive across fisheries stock assessments and brings risks of basing assessments on incorrect or incomplete model forms. In our case studies we identify several approaches for addressing this challenge, such as implementing sensitivity analyses to various assumptions and ensemble modeling where outputs from various assumptions are combined in a probabilistic way.

<!-- CH: I reworded this text in the paragraphs above. Can remove I think...
it may not be possible to estimate $S_{gen}$, as was seen in the Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser study case. When $S_{gen}$ estimates are not available and alternative single metric benchmarks are used, e.g. abundance percentiles, the status assessments between the rapid multidimensional scanning tool and single metric approach diverge more often. For example, in the Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser study case, the LRP was triggered more often when percentile benchmarks were used. Whereas when the distributional target was used as a metric for the Interior Fraser coho study case, the LRP was triggered less often when compared to rapid multidimensional scanning tool. This is likely associated with the fact that alternative single metric benchmarks are usually more volatile then assessments results based on $S_{gen}$ or the rapid multidimensional scanning tool. In addition, using the rapid multidimensional scanning tool allows for the consideration of CUs that would otherwise be considered data deficient, thus allowing cor a more complete assessment of the SMU status. This was illustrated in the Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser study case, as the exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series led to overoptimistic assessments.

<!--CH: perhaps we can just have subheadings for logistic regression-based LRPs and projection-based RLPS  within the heading "SMU-level LRPs and assessment" above, i.e., remove this heading here?  We don't really have anything to say about ppn-based LRPs not captured above, which I think are points that pertain to aggregate-abundance based LRP as well.

## Aggregate abundance-based LRPs

### Logistic regression-based LRPs

Logistic regression-based LRPs are empirically derived from the past observations of SMU abundance and CU statuses. In this method we apply a logistic regression to identify historical abundance levels associated with probabilities that all component CUs have statuses above their lower benchmarks. Similarly to the proportion-based LRP, this aggregate abundance method depends on the outcomes of individual CU assessments, which are sensitive to structural assumptions underlying the CU-level benchmarks and data availability. 
<!--CH: i restructed the text below a bit-->

There are several disadvantages of the logistic regression-based LRPs. First, our implementation of logistic-regression LRPs relied on a single metric for CU assessments, such as $S_{gen}$ or the distributional target method applied to the Interior Fraser River coho study case study, which is not consistent with the recommendation to to apply the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner tool for CU assessments within proportion-based LRPs. We did not include CU assessments based on the multidimensional approach for logistic-regression based LRPs in part because those statuses include trend metrics which introduce autocorrelation into CU statuses, a violation of logistic regression model (see Section 2 for more  details). 

Second, logistic regression-based LRPs are only estimable when there are years when all CUs or sub-populations are above their lower benchmark and years when at least one CU is below their lower benchmarks. This was not the case for the WCVI Chinook study case due to one inlet always been below its lower benchmark. 

Third, model diagnostics do not support logistic regressions and their associated LRPs when CU-level abundances are not correlated or only weakly correlated. For these SMUs, the aggregate abundances are not a significant indicator of individual CU statuses. Here, we found that logistic regression-based LRPs were estimable for interior Fraser coho (average correlation within CUS of 0.43) <!--I remember seeing the values of correlation between CU escapements(?), but I cannot find it in the current text. Where could I find those numbers? --> but not estimable for Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser (average correlation within CUs of XX). Also, the wide rand in productivities and capacities among CUs for the Inside South Coast Chum case study contributed to the weak relationship between aggregate abundances and CU-level statuses. In general, model diagnostics as described in \@ref(MethodsChapters) can be used to support or reject logistic-regression based LRPs.

<!-- CH: I think this is the same concept as mentioned in the text above for SMU assessmetns in general.  Is there something different about missing data with logistic regression LRPs that we can highlight. Otherwise omit this pgh?-->Missing data for individual CUs within an SMU may also pose a problem for the estimation of logistic regression-based LRPs. When data are missing for one or more CUs within and SMU, it may still be appropriate to apply the logistic regression-based LRP to the remaining CUs with data to assess status for the entire SMU. This is particularly true if there are high levels of covariation between the CUs. However, the logistic regression model fit will degenerate as the number of CUs with missing data increases. Sensitivity analysis for the Interior Fraser Coho study case showed that the model fit degenerated when two CU data sets were removed from the analysis. The influence of missing data was also dependent on the status of the CU for which data was missing. The omission of a CU with red status will be more influential that omitting data for a CU with amber or green status <!--CH I think this comes down to if they covary or not, and more specifically if they meet the 4 criteria for reprsenativeness. WE don't actually know if they covary if they are data-limited or data-deficient, hence we have to rely on the criteria. --> because the red status would trigger the LRP and change the SMU status for the logistic regression, biasing the aggregate abundance LRP to lower values. 

<!--CH: maybe combine with 3rd challenge above? I suggest some text above, so could omit this here?-->Finally, it is important to inspect model diagnostics and statistically test the model assumptions whenever applying the logistic regression-based LRPs. In chapter \@ref(lrp-estimation-methods) we provide a list of model diagnostics that should be checked when applying this aggregate abundance LRP estimation method. In addition, we illustrate how the diagnostics are used in support of the model fit in chapter \@ref(IFCChapter), and against the model fit in the \@ref(ISCchumChapter).    

<!--CH: Additional point that LRPs will vary over time with underlying stock-recruitment (or percentile benchmarks). This is mentioned with the IFR coho retrospective analysis removing years of data. LRPs were more temporally variable when based on SR benchmarks (which themselves varied over time) compared with distribution based benchmarks which were static. This is a point we make in the guidelines paper. If we can point to it in our results it would be good, even if the evidence isn't super strong.-->

### Projection based LRPs

<!--
CW Question: Why did we not apply the projection-based LRP to the Chum study case? Was is because we had no means of estimating the SR parameters for the Chum CUs? If that is the case, would it be correct to say that the projection-based LRP is not appropriate for data poor scenarios? 
-->

The projection-based LRPs approach relies on closed-loop simulation model to project future CU abundances. These projections are then used to identify the relationship between aggregate SMU abundances and the probabilities that all CUs are above their lower benchmarks, given a predefined level of exploitation. The most important requirement for our implementation of projection-based LRPs is the availability of information on productivity and capacity for the CUs within an SMU, and covariance in dynamics among them. Parameter estimates for productivity and capacity can be based on posterior distributions from stock recruitment analyses (see interior Fraser Coho study case, chapter \@ref(IFCChapter)) or more qualitatively from expert input, life-stage models, or watershed-area model estimates (see WCVI Chinook study case, chapter \@ref(WCVIchinookChapter)). We did not estimate projection-based LRPs for Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser study case because peer-reviewed estimates of capacity and productivity were not available for the CUs within that SMU. <!--CH: I suggest omitting this last sentence because, they weren't available for WCVI chinook, yet we still did it, and same could have been true for ISC but we ran out of time. I have included some text in CH 5, which I think is sufficient to address this point without bringing it up again.-->

The projection-based LRP approach is flexible and allows for consideration of structural uncertainty in the SMU population dynamics via consideration of alternative future scenarios. For example, for the WCVI chinook case study, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impacts of correlations in recruitment residuals and  variability in exploitation among inlets. For the interior Fraser coho study case, sensitivity analyses were performed regarding the variability in marine survival coefficient among CUs. Future implementations of the projection-based LRPs could also take into consideration shifts in stock recruitment parameters, and future changes in fishery exploitation rates. 

We also demonstrated that the projection-based LRPs is sensitive to the assumed levels of exploitation rate in the projections. Higher exploitation rates resulted in higher required SMU aggregate abundance to ensure that all CUs remain above their lower benchmarks. The sensitivity to exploitation rate increases as variability among stock-recruitment parameters increase, and also as uncertainty in parameter estimates increase. This property of projection-based LRPs is explored in Appendix \@ref(sensitivity-of-projection-based-lrps-to-exploitation-rates). This feature of the approach could be used in future exercises to identify the optimum levels of exploitation, to ensure that the aggregate abundance LRP is in line with current observed abundances.

	Summary points by chapter below


Key points for ISC chum: 

For data poor stocks, data quality issues may limit the choice of CU-specific benchmarks used as basis for the calculation of the SMU LRP. For example, for the ISC chum study case, $Sgen$ could not be reliably estimated for all CUs, and its use lead to poor fits of the logistic aggregate abundance LRP (although fits were poor regardless of the benchmark used). For that study case, the analyses relied on the percentile-based benchmarks. CH: suggest removing Sgen.

The choice of benchmark to determine CU specific status will affect the classification and therefore will also affect the LRP. 

Percentile benchmarks were more conservative that multidimensional status, i.e. LRP was triggered more often when percentile benchmarks were used.  -- But I am not clear if this is a trend to be expected for other SMUs of if it's specific to ISC chum. 

Adding more CUs lead to LRP being triggered more often. -> this indicates that exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series may lead to more overly optimistic assessments. 

Aggregate abundance LRPs were not appropriate. Factors include: 
-different orders of magnitude in variation among CU
-lack of auto correlation in escapements
-wide range in productivity values between CUs 


WCVI Chinook main points: 

Carrie already wrote a great set of summary bullets by the end of that chapter. Maybe reinforce them here. 

Recommendation to exclude CUs and/or inlets with PNI <0.5 (maybe better considered in the guidelines, under the section on when maight be appropriate to consider less than 100% of CUs above LRP)

Proportion of CU above benchmarks indicate that SMU is below LRP because one specific CU is consistently below its lower benchmark. Aggregate abundance logistic regression-based LRPs are not estimable as there are no years in which the SMU is above LRP. 



Some ideas include:

- If data limitations arise in application of LRP to a stock, increased monitoring, data quality could be part of recovery plan/ trigger


IFC main points:

proportion based LRP: Three methods for calculating lower bench marks were used, results vary among methods. The LRP was more likely to be triggered when relying on the distributional status was used to assess the stock. When the multi dimensional status assessment was used, the choice of ricker model used to estimate Sgen affected the frequency of assessing at least one CU as red status. The LRP  was triggered more often when using the Ricker_priorCap model than when using the Ricker model. 

Aggregate abundance

Retrospective analyses indicated that aggregate status estimates become unstable if two or more 
CUs are missing data.
