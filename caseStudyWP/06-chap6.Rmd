## Proportion-based LRPs

The proportion-based LRPs are the simplest assessment method presented. It consists in verifying is all CUs within the SMU of interest are assessed to be above their lower benchmarks or above the red zone. Complications related to applying proportion-based LRPs arrise when considering the range of data availability for salmon CUs. The data availability will determine what metrics are used for the CU status assessment and wether an assessment can be made at all. Recommendations on when it may be appropriate to use a subset of CUs as proxy for all CUs within an SMU are provided in the companion Guidelines paper (Holt et al In review).   

The case studies in this paper considered a variety of metrics and assessment methods for determining status of individual CUs. 

We found that using $S_{gen}$ as single metric lower benchmark resulted in similar outcomes to using the the multi-dimensional assessment tool. This similarities occur because in most years the muti-dimensional approach relies on $Sgen$ estimates to assess status, as was seen on both Interior Fraser coho and WCVI chinook study cases. Exceptions occur when the $Sgen$ estimates are below population thresholds (e.g. below 1500 spawners), as was seen in the Interior Fraser coho study case. When alternative single metric benchmarks are used, e.g. abundance percentiles, the status assessments between the multi-dimensional tool and single metric approach diverge more. This is likely associated with the fact that percentile and trend based benchmarks are usually less reliable in assessing status when compared to $S_{gen}$ <!--CW:Is there a better way of saying that? I mean they can be more variable/biased than Sgen-->. By combining multiple metrics, the multi-dimensional status assessment tool likely improves the reliability of the assessment results. However, the importance of valiating status assessments with expert review should not be undermined, particularly in data-pooor scenarios.

Ask KH: is it true that:
For the proportion-based LRP, using $Sgen$ as single metric lower benchmark resulted in similar outcomes to using the the multi-dimensional status assessment tool. This similarities occur because in most years the muti-dimensional approach relies on $Sgen$ estimates to assess status, as was seen on both Interior Fraser coho and WCVI chinook study cases. 
 Exceptions occur when generational mean of spawners dip below 1500 fish.  
For the proportion-based LRP, results tend to be more sensitive to the choice of recruitment function used to estimate the lower benchmarks, i.e., $Sgen$. as was demonstrated in the IFC study case.  

Need to confirm with Luke:


-->

Different results will be produced depending on the methods used to estimate the Cu specific lower benchmarks. 
Even when abundance bases lower benchmarks are available i.e. Sgen, the choice of recryuitmen model being used will influence the resulting SMU status. (mention coho example)

Multi dimensional approach may be preferred as it incorporates multiple data sources, but results should be reviewed with expert input. 



## Aggregate abundance-based LRPs

### Logistic regression-based LRPs

Only estimable when there are years when all CUs or sub-populations are above their lower benchmark and years when at least one CU is below their lower benchmarks, i.e. there are both 0s and 1s in the SMU status time series. 

results depend on the lower benchmark used for determining the underlying CU status, which in turn will depend on data availability. 

Individual CU must have moderate to high level of covariation, -- compare Chum and coho estimates.

Model diagnostics and statistical testing of model assumptions will shed light on reiability of model estimates.  

### Projection based LRPs

- allows for consideration of structural uncertainty via consideration of alternative future scenarios. 
- Results depend on the level of exploitation rates assumed in future projections with higher exploitation rates resulting in higher aggregate abundance LRPs
- Need to review result of IFc to take a few points from there

Key points for ISC chum: 

For data poor stocks, data quality issues may limit the choice of CU-specific benchmarks used as basis for the calculation of the SMU LRP. For example, for the ISC chum study case,$Sgen$ could not be reliably estimated for all CUs, and its use lead to poor fits of the logistic aggregate abundance LRP (although fits were poor regardless of the benchmark used). For that study case, the analyses relied on the percentile-based benchmarks. 

The choice of benchmark to determine CU specific status will affect the classification and therefore will also affect the LRP. 

Percentile benchmarks were more conservative that multidimensional status, i.e. LRP was triggered more often when percentile benchmarks were used.  -- But I am not clear if this is a trend to be expected for other SMUs of if it's specific to ISC chum. 

Adding more CUs lead to LRP being triggered more often. -> this indicates that exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series may lead to more overly optimistic assessments. 

Aggregate abundance LRPs were not appropriate. Factors include: 
-different orders of magnitude in variation among CU
-lack of auto correlation in escapements
-wide range in productivity values between CUs 


WCVI Chinook main points: 

Carrie already wrote a great set of summary bullets by the end of that chapter. Maybe reinforce them here. 

Recommendation to exclude CUs and/or inlets with PNI <0.5 (maybe better considered in the guidelines, under the section on when maight be appropriate to consider less than 100% of CUs above LRP)

Proportion of CU above benchmarks indicate that SMU is below LRP because one specific CU is consistently below its lower benchmark. Aggregate abundance logistic regression-based LRPs are not estimable as there are no years in which the SMU is above LRP. 



Some ideas include:

- If data limitations arise in application of LRP to a stock, increased monitoring, data quality could be part of recovery plan/ trigger


IFC main points:

proportion based LRP: Three methods for calculating lower bench marks were used, results vary among methods. The LRP was more likely to be triggered when relying on the distributional status was used to assess the stock. When the multi dimensional status assessment was used, the choice of ricker model used to estimate Sgen affected the frequency of assessing at least one CU as red status. The LRP  was triggered more often when using the Ricker_priorCap model than when using the Ricker model. 

Aggregate abundance

Retrospective analyses indicated that aggregate status estimates become unstable if two or more 
CUs are missing data.
