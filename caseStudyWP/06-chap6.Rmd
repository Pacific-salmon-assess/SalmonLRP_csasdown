# LESSONS LEARNED FROM CASE STUDY APPLICATIONS


## CU-LEVEL BENCHMARKS AND ASSESSMENTS

LRPs described in this working paper rely on CU-level benchmarks and assessments, for which data vary in quality and quantity. Our case studies demonstrate the application of proportion-based and aggregate-abundance based LRPs to SMUs containing CUs with a range of data availability including those with stock-recruitment benchmarks, habitat-based benchmarks, and percentile-based benchmarks. In addition, we demonstrate assessments for SMUs containing CUs without abundance-based benchmarks where statuses rely on short and long-term trends over time, as demonstrated in application of multidimensional assessments within the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner to Inside Southcoast Chum - Non Fraser. 

At the CU-level, we found that using a single metric, spawner abundances relative to a WSP lower benchmark (S~gen~ or percentiles) resulted in similar status assessments to using the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner.   These similarities occur because when lower benchmark estimates are available, the Salmon Scanner tool will usually default to assessing status against them, as was demonstrated for all three case studies. Exceptions occur when the lower benchmark estimates are below the absolute population thresholds (e.g., below 1500 spawners) and available spawner time-series are absolute numbers, as occurred for the Interior Fraser Coho study case for one CU in three years. In these cases, the Salmon Scanner triggered red status due to low abundances below the absolute conservation threshold even though the stock-recruitment based lower benchmark was not breached.

In addition, we found that using the Salmon Scanner allows for the consideration of CUs that would otherwise be considered data deficient using single metric on spawner abundances relative to benchmarks, thus allowing for a more complete assessment of the SMU status. In these cases, the Salmon Scanner is able to provide an assessment of status based on short and long-term trends when benchmarks on spawner abundances are not available, as demonstrated in the Inside South Coast Chum case study. <!--CW: added the following to emphasize the importance of assessing more CUs -->  The possibility of assessing CUs lacking abundance-based lower benchmarks is particularly important when SMUs are composed of CUs  <!--CH If they are data-deficient, we don't know if they have low levels of synchrony. I suggest changing this next phrase to , "that differ in threats, environmental conditions, life-history characteristics or population capacities", instead of "with low levels of synchrony"-->with low levels of synchrony in which data deficient CUs cannot be represented by proxy. For example, for Inside South Coast Chum - Non Fraser, we found that status relative to LRP changed as additional data-limited CUs were considered using the Salmon Scanner, which could not be assessed using single-metric on spawner abundances relative to percentile-based benchmarks. These data-limited CUs have unique biological and landscape characteristics, such that the data-rich CUs in this SMU are not appropriate indicators for their status. <!--CH: Luke does this sound okay?-->

## PROPORTION-BASED LRPS

The reliability of proportion-based LRP estimates depends on the reliability of individual CU status estimates. The effect of uncertainty in CU-level benchmarks on resulting estimates of LRP status was apparent in the Interior Fraser Coho case study where two different structural assumptions in stock-recruitment model fit were considered. These two model fits resulted in different estimates of productivity and carrying capacity for individual CUs, as well as different estimates of S~gen~. These two model formulations resulted in different estimates of SMU status relative to LRPs for all estimation methods considered for Interior Fraser Coho. In addition to the form of the stock-recruitment model, CU-statuses and hence SMU-level LRPs and statuses can be sensitive to the metric used to for CU assessments (e.g., spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark vs. the distribution of spawners, as considered in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study).  


The decision on which structural form or type of benchmark to consider depends on the biological characteristics of the populations and available data, highlighting the importance of considering expert knowledge and peer-reviewed WSP assessments for determining CU status. The challenge of identifying the most appropriate model form is pervasive across fisheries stock assessments and brings risks of basing assessments on incorrect or incomplete model forms. In our case studies we identify several approaches for addressing this challenge, such as implementing sensitivity analyses to various assumptions and (for projection-based LRPs in particular) <!--CH: added this caveat in parentheses, as we didn't actually implement ensemble modelling approaches for proportion-based LRPs, the focus of this section-->using ensemble modeling where outputs from various assumptions are combined in a probabilistic way.


In addition, we found that removing component CUs from assessments impacted SMU-level status, resulting in SMU assessments that may be more pessimistic or optimistic than when all CUs are considered, depending on the level of covariation among CUs, status of other component CUs, and CU sizes. <!--CH: I added in this caveat specifying proportion-based LRPs in the next sentence. Does that make sense? It's much more convoluted for agg abund-based LRPs-->However, for proportion-based LRPs in particular, there is an asymmetry in how missing CUs may affect SMU status relative to the LRP. If the LRP of 100% of CUs above red status has been breached for an SMU, the inclusion of additional CUs may further deplete or improve status (% of CUs above red), but will not increase status to above the LRP (100%). In contrast, if the proportion-based LRP is not breached for an SMU, then the inclusion of additional CUs may deplete status to below the LRP or keep status at 100% of CUs above red zone, as seen for Inside South Coast Chum - Non Fraser. For this case study, the exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series led to overoptimistic assessments in some years compared to when those CUs were included. In those years, SMU status would be data-deficient because status of the data-limited CUs excluded from analysis could not be inferred from data-rich CUs that were above red status<!--CH: added this last sentence to align with our decision about DD SMU in Guidelines paper, and the next sentence to show the alternative scenario-->. In recent years, however, at least one data-rich CU has been depleted to red status, providing an SMU status below the proportion-based LRP of 100% (not data deficient) despite the exclusion of several CUs. These results highlight the importance of including data from all component CUs when possible. Guidelines on identifying where data-rich CUs are more likely to provide status that is representative of data-deficient CUs is provided in Holt et al. (in review). We recommend that CU-level assessments and decisions about CU representativeness when developing SMU-level LRPs be peer-reviewed to ensure they result in robust and reliable LRPs.<!--CH: suggest we remove following sentence, as I'm not sure who would have this disincentive. We could mention it in our pptx "The asymmetrical impact of increased monitoring of CUs on SMU status may reduce incentives to extend monitoring to data-deficient CUs"-->

### Logistic regression-based LRPs

Logistic regression-based LRPs are empirically derived from past observations of SMU abundance and CU statuses. By fitting a logistic regression to historical data, we identified historical abundance levels associated with probabilities that all component CUs have statuses above their lower benchmarks. Similar to the proportion-based LRP, this aggregate abundance-based method depends on the outcomes of individual CU assessments, which are sensitive to structural assumptions underlying the CU-level benchmarks and data availability. Logistic regression-based LRPs could only be estimated for one of our three case study SMUs, which suggests that they may only be an option for a small proportion of SMUs. Logistic regression models could not be reliably fit for West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook and Inner South Coast Chum SMUs. In the case of WCVI Chinook, lack of contrast in available data was the key limitation, while in the case of Inner South Coast Chum, the limitation was an apparent lack of an underlying relationship between CU statuses and aggregate SMU abundances. Even for Interior Fraser Coho where a logistic regression fit was possible, estimates did not converge for all retrospective years, and status estimates were sensitive to missing data. Taken together, our exploration of logistic regression LRPs for our three case studies highlighted several key limitations and disadvantages with this approach.



There are several disadvantages of the logistic regression-based LRPs. First, our implementation of logistic-regression LRPs relied on a single metric for CU assessments, such as S~gen~ or the distributional target method applied to the Interior Fraser River Coho study case study, which is not consistent with the recommendation to to apply the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner for CU assessments within proportion-based LRPs. We did not include CU assessments based on the Salmon Scanner for logistic-regression based LRPs in part because those statuses include trend metrics which introduce autocorrelation into CU statuses, a violation of logistic regression model (see Section \@ref(MethodsChapter) for more details). 


Second, logistic regression-based LRPs are limited to conditions that have been historically observed. This can be a problem when there is poor contrast in historical data, as was the case for WCVI Chinook.  In this case, there were no years when all component inlets were above their lower benchmarks. However, similar challenges could occur in cases where no CUs drop below their lower benchmarks.  The dependence on historically observed conditions is a further limitation if there have been changes in the correlation in populations dynamics among CUs over time such that current (or future) correlations are not represented by historical data.

Third, model diagnostics do not support logistic regressions and their associated LRPs when CU-level abundances are not correlated or only weakly correlated.  Here, we found that logistic regression-based LRPs were estimatable for interior Fraser Coho (average correlation within CUS of 0.43), but not estimable for Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser (average correlation within CUs of 0.12). Also, the wide range in productivities and capacities among CUs for the Inside South Coast Chum case study contributed to the weak relationship between aggregate abundances and CU-level statuses. In general, model diagnostics as described in \@ref(MethodsChapters) can be used to support or reject logistic regression-based LRPs. We illustrate how these diagnostics are used to evaluate model fit in Sections \@ref(IFCChapter) and \@ref(ISCchumChapter).    


Similar to proportion-based LRPs, CUs without reliable data poses a problem for the estimation of logistic regression-based LRPs. When CUs abundances covary strongly, it may be possible to use data-rich CUs as indicators for data-limited CUs. However, in our case study on Interior Fraser River Coho, we found that logistic regression-based LRPs were more uncertain when more than 1 CUs was missing. 



### Projection based LRPs


Projection-based LRPs rely on closed-loop simulation models to project future CU abundances. These projections are then used to quantify the emergent relationship between aggregate SMU abundances and the probabilities that all CUs are above their lower benchmarks, given a predefined level of exploitation. The most important requirements for this approach are CU-specific estimates of stock-recruitment parameters, productivity and capacity, and covariance in recruitment among CUs. Parameter estimates for productivity and capacity can be based on posterior distributions from stock recruitment analyses (see Interior Fraser Coho case study, Section \@ref(IFCChapter)) or more qualitatively from expert input, life-stage models, or watershed-area model estimates (see WCVI Chinook case study, Section \@ref(WCVIchinookChapter)). <!--CH suggested new text (Catarina and Kendra thoughts?) In other marine fisheries, tuning the OM is a critical component of simulation-evaluations. Does this count as 'tuning?'--> Furthermore, we demonstrated an approach to choosing parameters and model assumptions used in the projections so that correlations in spawner abundances in projections were similar to observed correlations.  We recommend that correlations in CUs within projections are explored under various model assumptions, and that model parameters are tuned to derive realistic correlations.

The projection-based LRP approach is flexible and allows for consideration of structural uncertainty in the SMU population dynamics and consideration of alternative future scenarios. For example, for the WCVI Chinook case study, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impacts of correlations in recruitment residuals and variability in exploitation among inlets. For the Interior Fraser Coho study case, sensitivity analyses were performed regarding the variability in marine survival coefficient among CUs. Future implementations of the projection-based LRPs could also take into consideration shifts in stock recruitment parameters, and future changes in fishery exploitation rates. 

We also demonstrated that projection-based LRPs are sensitive to the assumed levels of exploitation in the projections. Higher exploitation rates resulted in higher required SMU aggregate abundance to ensure that all CUs remain above their lower benchmarks. The sensitivity to exploitation rate increases as variability in stock-recruitment parameters among CUs increase, and also as uncertainty in parameter estimates increase. This property of projection-based LRPs is explored in Appendix \@ref(app:ERsensitivity-appendix). Therefore projection-based LRPs developed under historical and current exploitation rates cannot necessarily be used as a basis for evaluating alternative management procedures. However demonstrating the changes in aggregate abundances required for all CUs to be above lower benchmarks (i.e. changes in projection-based LRP) under different exploitation scenarios may help analysts and managers understand the implications of changing exploitation rates on the ability to achieve WSP objectives.







<!-- KH: (CH: I think the first three are captured with some additions I made above, but could add the last if there is interest...?)

I wonder if another discussion topic could be the dependence of LRP estimates on reliable estimates of CU status.    
E.g.,:
CW:opening paragraph of SMU-level LRPs and assessments
All of the LRP estimation methods we considered were based on status estimates for component CUs; regardless of whether it was a proportion-based or abundance-based method. As a result, the reliability of LRP estimates is a function of the reliability of individual CU status estimates. The effect of uncertainty in CU-level benchmarks on resulting estimates of LRP status was apparent in the Interior Fraser Coho case study where two different structural assumptions in stock recruitment model fit were considered. These two model fits resulted in different estimates of productivity and carrying capacity for individual CUs, as well as different estimates of Sgen. These two different model formulations resulted in different estimates of SMU status relative to LRPs over time for all LRP estimation methods considered for Interior Fraser Coho.    


- Could we also draw on Carrie's sensitivity analysis of productivity when estimating projected LRPs here?  Different productivity assumptions led to different Sgens, which lead to different LRPs.

- Could end this section by noting that the guidelines paper recommends that a peer-review of CU status estimates is required prior to developing LRPs. (I think Carrie mentioned this ... but should check guidlelines paper to confirm what it says.  I think Carrie said she had included 'reliabale CU status estimates' as a key principle??) 

- Could then go on to discuss ways in which uncertainty in CU status can get rolled up into LRP estimates.  For example, integrated model fits for logistic regression propogate uncertainty through to LRP estimates. Or, model-averaging for projection-based (coho example). At this point, I don't think there are ways to incorporate uncertainty into CU status estimates from the multidimensional scanning tool. (Although, is SOTS working on this???)  May be something to flag as a research priority???

	Summary points by chapter below


Key points for ISC chum: 

For data poor stocks, data quality issues may limit the choice of CU-specific benchmarks used as basis for the calculation of the SMU LRP. For example, for the ISC chum study case, $Sgen$ could not be reliably estimated for all CUs, and its use lead to poor fits of the logistic aggregate abundance LRP (although fits were poor regardless of the benchmark used). For that study case, the analyses relied on the percentile-based benchmarks. CH: suggest removing Sgen.

The choice of benchmark to determine CU specific status will affect the classification and therefore will also affect the LRP. 

Percentile benchmarks were more conservative that multidimensional status, i.e. LRP was triggered more often when percentile benchmarks were used.  -- But I am not clear if this is a trend to be expected for other SMUs of if it's specific to ISC chum. 

Adding more CUs lead to LRP being triggered more often. -> this indicates that exclusion of CUs with incomplete time series may lead to more overly optimistic assessments. 

Aggregate abundance LRPs were not appropriate. Factors include: 
-different orders of magnitude in variation among CU
-lack of auto correlation in escapements
-wide range in productivity values between CUs 


WCVI Chinook main points: 

Carrie already wrote a great set of summary bullets by the end of that chapter. Maybe reinforce them here. 

Recommendation to exclude CUs and/or inlets with PNI <0.5 (maybe better considered in the guidelines, under the section on when maight be appropriate to consider less than 100% of CUs above LRP)

Proportion of CU above benchmarks indicate that SMU is below LRP because one specific CU is consistently below its lower benchmark. Aggregate abundance logistic regression-based LRPs are not estimable as there are no years in which the SMU is above LRP. 



Some ideas include:

- If data limitations arise in application of LRP to a stock, increased monitoring, data quality could be part of recovery plan/ trigger


IFC main points:

proportion based LRP: Three methods for calculating lower bench marks were used, results vary among methods. The LRP was more likely to be triggered when relying on the distributional status was used to assess the stock. When the multi dimensional status assessment was used, the choice of ricker model used to estimate Sgen affected the frequency of assessing at least one CU as red status. The LRP  was triggered more often when using the Ricker_priorCap model than when using the Ricker model. 

Aggregate abundance

Retrospective analyses indicated that aggregate status estimates become unstable if two or more 
CUs are missing data.
