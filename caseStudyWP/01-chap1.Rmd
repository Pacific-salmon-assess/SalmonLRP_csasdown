# INTRODUCTION


<!--CH comment: I've used Holt et al. (in review) to refer to the other paper, as when we provide to CSAS participants, both papers will be in review, not in prep. Does that make sense? I think we should be consistent either way. I think the only papers still in prep., are Grant et al. for the Salmon Scanner and Marentette et al.'s National guidance on LRPs.
KH: Agreed, I have corrected this throughout

Under recent amendments to Canada's Fisheries Act, Limit Reference Points (LRPs) will be required for all major fish stocks prescribed in regulation. Stocks that drop below their LRP will trigger the development of a rebuilding plan. For Pacific salmon, it is anticipated there will be more than 65 major fish stocks (or stock management units, SMUs), where the proposed functional definition of a SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. Under the WSP, a CU is defined as ‘a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations’ [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005]. Thus, while LRPs under the Fisheries Act are required at the SMU-level, monitoring and management under DFO's WSP occurs at the finer CU level. Methods to assess CU status have been identified for a range of data types, including WSP Integrated Assessment methods (hereafter called 'WSP assessments') that use expert opinion to combine multiple metrics into a single estimate of CU status [e.g., @grant2017FraserSockeye2020]. Metrics used to assess WSP CU status include spawner abundances, short- and long-term trends in abundance, and distribution of abundance [@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009]. Lower and upper benchmarks on those metrics are used to assign status into one of three zones, Green, Amber and Red, representing increasingly depleted populations that require increasing management intervention, respectively [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005]. A more fulsome description of these concepts is provided in the companion paper,  *Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units* (Holt et al., in review)^[Holt et. al. Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units. CSAS Working Paper. In review]. At present, a key gap in our ability to develop LRPs under the Fisheries Act is that CU-level status assessments have not been aggregated to the SMU level.


LRPs are defined within DFO's 'Precautionary Approach to Fisheries Decision-Making' as the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock [@dfoFisheryDecisionmakingFramework2009]. While LRPs are often based on metrics directly linked to productivity, such as spawning biomass or fishing mortality rates, the type of metric used to define an LRP can vary among species and data types, and may be related to other stock characteristics when appropriate. Since the CU is the fundamental unit of biodiversity that DFO aims to maintain under the WSP, it follows that metrics used to set LRPs for Pacific salmon should be linked to the status of component CUs within an SMU. Our companion paper, Holt et al., (in review) argues that the maintenance of CU-level spawning abundances above levels that would cause serious harm is the key biological requirement for Pacific salmon LRPs.  


The goals of this working paper are to demonstrate alternative LRP estimation methods for three case study SMUs, and then evaluate candidate LRPs using a combination of sensitivity analyses and, where possible, retrospective analyses. A full evaluation of LRPs, for example, using closed-loop simulations, is beyond the scope of the current project and is a high priority for future research. The case studies considered are Interior Fraser Coho Salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon (*O. tshawytscha*), and Inside South Coast Chum Salmon (*O. keta*;  excluding Fraser River CUs). Each of these SMUs consists of 3-7 CUs and was selected to represent a different level of data availability ranging from data rich (Interior Fraser Coho) to data-limited (Inside South Coast Chum and West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook). Detailed guidelines for identifying LRPs for Pacific salmon SMUs informed by these three case study applications are available in the companion working paper (Holt et al., in review)<!--KH: footnote already cited; subscript needs to be added at a later point-->. For each case study, the set of LRP estimation methods considered is a function of available data and previously developed assessment methods for the SMU. The LRPs presented in this paper are illustrative and not meant to provide formal assessments, as they may require more thorough review of data and assumptions with local analysts and partners.
