# SENSITIVITY OF PROJECTION-BASED LRPS TO EXPLOITATION RATES{#app:ERsensitivity-appendix}


To explain the initially counter-intuitive result of the sensitivity of projection based LRPs to exploitation rates, we ran an additional analysis where the spawner-recruitment parameters, productivity (log($alpha$)) and spawners at replacement, S~REP~ (log($alpha$)/$beta$) were either varied or kept constant over inlets and Monte Carlo trials. 

Specifically, we evaluated the sensitivity of aggregate projection-based LRPs to exploitation rates under three alternative scenarios, as applied to the case study on WCVI Chinook Salmon:

1. All component inlets were assumed to have stock-recruitment parameters drawn from the same distributions (the mean and standard deviation for productivity and S~REP~ as estimated for Quatsino, west coast Vancouver Island) but a unique set of stock-recruitment parameters was drawn for each inlet and trial (i.e., each inlet was a replicate of each other with random variability). We chose to draw S~REP~ from a random distributions instead of Ricker $beta$ or S~MAX~ (1/$beta$) because the spawner-recruitment relationship was parameterized with S~REP~ for this case study. In preliminary sensitivity analyses, we sampled from a random distribution of $beta$ values and found similar results. We assumed strong positive covariation in recruitment residuals among inlets with pairwise correlations equal to 0.7. 

2. The productivity parameter was fixed at the mean of the assumed distribution for all inlets and trials. S~REP~ was drawn from its distribution and allowed to vary across inlets and trials. The same distribution of S~REP~ was used across inlets and trials, as in Scenario 1. 


3. S~REP~ was fixed at the mean of the distribution across inlets and across trials. The productivity parameter was drawn from the distribution and allowed to vary across inlets and trials. The same distribution of productivity was used across inlets and trials, as in Scenario 1.


We found that the sensitivity of projection-based LRPs to exploitation rates was due to variability in productivity and to a lesser extent S~REP~ among inlets. In Scenario 1, when we applied a relatively high exploitation rate (45%), productivity and S~REP~ tended to be lower for random trials and inlets that dropped below the lower benchmark in at least one year (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-SRHistEven)). Random trials and inlets with abundances that remained above the lower benchmark over the time-series tended to be more productive and slightly larger.

Inlets and Monte Carlo trials with low productivity tended to have relatively high S~gen~ (lower benchmark) values (as described in @holtCautionsUsingPercentilebased2015), and therefore a higher frequency of dropping below the lower benchmark. This variability in productivity among inlets was associated with projection-based LRPs that were sensitive to exploitation rates (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-ProjLRPs-Even)).

When productivity was fixed at the mean value among random trials and inlets in Scenario 2, the distribution of spawner-recruitment parameters for trials in which abundances dropped below the lower benchmark was the same or similar for trials that remained above it (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-SRHistSameProd)), and the LRP was insensitive to exploitation rate (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-ProjLRPs-SameProd)).

When S~REP~ was fixed at the mean value among inlets and random trials in Scenario 3, productivity was higher for inlets and trials that remained above benchmarks compared to those that dropped below them, similar to the scenario when both S~REP~ and productivity varied (Scenario 1) (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-SRHistSameSREP)). LRPs varied with exploitation rates but to a lesser extent than when both productivity and S~REP~ varied (Fig. \@ref(fig:chinook-ProjLRPs-SameSREP)).

Based on these sensitivity analyses, we conclude that variability in productivity among inlets results in inlet-specific variability in sensitivity to exploitation rates. Inlets with relatively low productivity fall below lower benchmarks more frequently. This effect is accentuated when exploitation rates are high resulting in divergences in statuses among inlets and a higher aggregate abundance is required for all inlets to be above their lower benchmarks resulting in a higher LRP. These results are generalizable to other SMUs to the extent that productivities differ among component CUs.
