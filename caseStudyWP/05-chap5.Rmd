# CASE STUDY 3: INSIDE SOUTH COAST CHUM - NON-FRASER

[//]: # Add a comment in colour: *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: some text}*

## CONTEXT

-SMU description
The Inside South Coast Chum Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes seven Conservation Units (CU) of chum salmon from rivers that drain into Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea along the mainland of British Columbia and the east coast of Vancouver Island (Figure \@ref(fig:map-chum)). This area includes deep fjords, glaciers, large rivers, and small coastal streams.

## DATA

-	Caveats

### Subsets of data used


We used essentially the same data used in `@holt_evaluating_2018`, updated with escapement data up to 2018. `@van_will_inner_2014` provides more details on the data sources, infilling procedures and run reconstruction, which were reproduced for this study and described below.

### Spawner counts / Escapement

Escapement data were downloaded from the NUSEDS database. Escapement data record the estimates of total spawners by stream and CU for each year.  Biologists from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and First Nations including ... (Island Marine Aquatic Working Group) *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: which ones?}* generate these data by walking streams and counting fish, and using fences or weirs on some rivers. If there was more than one count for a stream in a given year, total escapement was estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) method.

### Fishery harvest

The number of chum caught in fisheries in the Inside South Coast area were taken from the DFO Clockwork Database, which includes the DFO Fishery Operating System and Sales slip databases and Genetic Stock Identification data. 

### Data treatment

-- Hatchery stocks removed from data set (provide a few details)
-- Escapement data: Infilling of escapement data: (i) summarize infilling methods (ii) show plot of infilled escapement series for all 7 CUs (iii) describe that we are only using 5 CUs without CU infilling for anlayses
-- Recruitment data: use of run reconstruction model

The steps for preparing the data for analysis were:

1. Infill total and wild escapement by CU and Area, (by stream for CUs with observations, by CU for years with no observations in a CU)
2. Add fishery catch by CU and Area to total escapement to estimate total returns / recruitment / stock *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: not sure which term to use here. Recruitment might be confusing since it is recruits in a spawning year, not for a brood year}*
3. Use proportion of wild:total escapement by CU and Area to estimate number of wild returns 
4. Use age proportions of catch to estimate age of returns and get recruits by brood year for each CU.
5. Result: wild spawners and corresponding recruits by brood year for each CU

#### Infilling of spawner escapement data 

#### Run reconstruction to estimate recruitment


## METHODS

### Benchmarks for Conservation Units

#### Benchmark based on stock-recruit relationship - Sgen

#### Benchmark based on historical abundance - Percentile

### Regression forms

Bernoulli vs. Binomial

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
d1 <- tribble(
  ~Year, ~`Value 1`, ~`Value 2`,
   2018,       1.12,       31.9,
   2019,       2.32,        2.8,
   2020,       3.67,      112.2)
if(french){
  names(d1) <- c(rosettafish::en2fr("Year"),
                 paste0(rosettafish::en2fr("Value"), 1),
                 paste0(rosettafish::en2fr("Value"), 2))
}
csasdown::csas_table(d1,
  align = c("c", "r", "r"),
  caption = ifelse(french,
                   "French goes here",
                   "Test table (data is d1) with a caption will be numbered automatically."))
```

### EMPIRICAL LRPS

- We evaluate two empirical (data-based) approaches for developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs for Inside South Coast Chum using the 5 CUs with > 15 years of data [not sure this is the best way to descibe??; please fix]. Both approaches attempted to estimate LRPs by fitting logistic regression models to historically observed data; they differ in the metric used to represent CU-level lower benchmarks.

- The first approach uses Sgen ...

- The second approach used percentile-based benchmarks ...

- Due to poor logistic model fits using the entire 19xx - 2018 time series for both Sgen and percentile benchmarks, we did not conduct retrospective analyses for this SMU. The underlying data characteristics that lead to poor logsitic model fits are highlighted in the results section below.


### PROJECTED LRPS (TBD)

### MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH (TBD)

## RESULTS

### EMPIRICAL LRPS

- Show poor model fits for each benchmark (using Bernoulli)
- Summarize model fit diagnostics
- Highlight low covariance and differences in scale, and describe how these make empirical LRPs unsuitable for this SMU
- Also - include plots showing variation in Sgen and percentile benchmarks over time for the 5 CUs to highlight time-varying concerns.
