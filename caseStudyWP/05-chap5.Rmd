# CASE STUDY 3: INSIDE SOUTH COAST CHUM - NON-FRASER{#ISCchumChapter}

<!-- # Add a comment in colour: *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: some text}* -->

## CONTEXT {#chum-context}

The Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser SMU (abbreviated as ISC Chum) includes 7 CUs of Chum Salmon from rivers that drain into Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea along the mainland of British Columbia and the east coast of Vancouver Island (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-map); @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007). This area includes deep fjords, glaciers, large rivers, and small coastal streams. Chum salmon CUs spawning in the Fraser River watershed are not included in this SMU. They have been categorized as a separate 'Inside South Coast Chum - Fraser' SMU. While these two SMUs have substantial overlap in ocean fisheries, they have been separated into two SMUs based on differences in terminal fishery impacts and freshwater habitats.

The ISC Chum SMU is considered data-limited. While escapement time series are available for many streams starting in 1953, several series are incomplete and require infilling assumptions (i.e., not all streams counted each year, some CUs have no counts in some years). In addition, run reconstructions of recruitment are uncertain, making the development of benchmarks based on spawner and recruitment data problematic. There are also no data on marine survival [although there are some scale/growth data in @debertinMarineGrowthPatterns2017]. Other unique characteristics of this SMU include high contrast in abundance among CUs and relatively low correlation in abundance among CUs over time. The SMU covers a large area with many diverse watersheds, flow regimes, and ocean entry locations. Wild Salmon Policy status assessments have not been done on any ISC Chum CUs. @godboutStockStatusWild2004 identified long-term increases or variable abundance in Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet and declines in Northeast Vancouver Island and especially in the Southern Coastal Streams CU (from 1953-2002). @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 found similar results in a provisional assessment of status. At this time, a peer-reviewed WSP status assessment has not been developed for ISC chum.


Holt et al. (in review) provide steps for applying LRPs to salmon SMUs, one of which is to identify if the status of data-deficient CUs can be represented by other data-rich CUs. This is relevant for the ISC Chum case study because two CUs have no observations in some years (Upper Knight and Bute Inlet). To infer status of data-deficient CUs from data-rich CUs, Holt et al. (in review) recommend providing evidence for similar threats, environmental drivers, biological characteristics, and population capacity among CUs.


Upper Knight and Bute Inlet CUs are both associated with long fjords that run from the Broughton Archipelago through the Coast Mountains. They include rivers with headwaters in the Cariboo region farther inland than other CUs in the SMU (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-map)). Southern Coastal Streams, Georgia Strait, and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet also include portions of the Coast Mountains and some glaciers, but to a lesser extent and their inlets are shorter and their watersheds do not go as far inland. Upper Knight and Bute Inlet are unique in that they are the only CUs in the SMU that only include watersheds that drain into the upper end of long inlets. They are both more remote than the other CUs, which is partly why there are fewer observations over time for Chum with fall run timing.


Chum from the Upper Knight and Bute Inlet CUs are exposed to different threats to habitat, survival and productivity than the other five CUs in both the freshwater and the early marine phase. While these two CUs have, on average, lower impacts from forest harvest, impervious area, and roads, they have larger impacts from forest defoliation and pests [@pacificsalmonfoundationPacificSalmonExplorer2021]. They may also have different levels of risk from disturbances such as glacier melt, avalanches, debris flows, and floods because they have large melting glaciers associated with lakes, steep slopes, and unstable terrain. In the Bute Inlet CU, the glacial lake outburst flood that caused a debris flow in the Southgate River in November 2020 is one example of such an event. These events are capable of killing an entire brood year of eggs/alevins and reshaping habitat with impacts on spawning habitat and stream ecosystems for many years. They can also change water quality in near shore marine habitats. These catastrophic events may be less likely in watersheds with gentler topography and that lack glaciers and glacial lakes. 


Environmental drivers, biological characteristics, and population capacity for Upper Knight and Bute Inlet CUs also differ from the other seven CUs. The hydrology of these two CUs likely differs from that of other CUs with more low-lying topography. The two largest watersheds in these CUs (Homathko and Klinaklini) fall within their own Freshwater Adaptive Zone, which indicates unique freshwater habitat conditions (Figure 76 and Table 52 in @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007). These watersheds have large glaciers and high amounts of snowmelt, compared to more low-elevation coastal watersheds with more rain-dominant hydrographs. Marine conditions when smolts enter the ocean in these systems may vary from that of the other five CUs, as they are entering the upper ends of large fjords. Competition with other salmon in the ocean and ocean conditions affect chum salmon in this SMU [@debertinMarineGrowthPatterns2017; @litzCompetitionOddyearPink2021], although declines in Pink salmon populations in this general area may suggest that these factors are not affecting these CUs only. Regarding biological characteristics, Bute Inlet and Upper Knight have a higher proportion of summer-run populations of Chum (Table \@ref(tab:CU-summary)). Recruits per spawner of the Upper Knight and Bute Inlet CUs (estimated using CU-level infilling, which introduces error) are more variable than for other CUs in this SMU, exhibiting very productive years (>100 recruits per spawner) and years with very low productivity. These CUs also have lower habitat capacity, with fewer streams with fall timed Chum spawners than the other CUs (Table \@ref(tab:CU-summary)). Based on these differences, we cannot infer the status for Bute Inlet and Upper Knight from the other CUs. Note that these criteria used to evaluate whether status can be inferred for these CUs extends to whether reliable spawner escapement data can be infilled using escapement in the other CUs. Thus, these CUs are dropped for years with no spawner data in this case study.

Previous evaluations of WSP benchmarks for Inner South Coast Chum have shown that percentile benchmarks can be comparable to those based on stock-recruit relationships when productivity is relatively high and harvest is relatively low [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. However, in some cases, percentile benchmarks may be inappropriate due to low productivity or high harvest, resulting in a shifting baseline [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018].


We chose the ISC Chum SMU as a case study because we were interested in exploring LRP options for a data-limited SMU without stock-recruitment or habitat-based benchmarks. We applied LRPs based on two methods: proportions of CUs above Red status, and aggregate abundance LRPs estimated using the logistic regression approach. 

## DATA

We used the same data used in @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018, but updated with five additional years of data. Available data included spawner abundance time series from 1959 - 2018 and corresponding CU-level recruitment estimated from run reconstruction. Spawner abundance series rely heavily on infilling; 60% of observations (count of spawners for an individual stream, in a given year) were missing and needed to be infilled. We chose to apply infilling procedures for this SMU when possible to develop metrics of wild spawner abundance since infilling methods for this SMU have been previously peer reviewed [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. This differs from the approach taken for WCVI Chinook, in which infilling methods were not implemented due to high and variable hatchery influences. Recruitment data are considered highly uncertain for all ISC Chum CUs due to uncertain assumptions required to assign mixed-fishery catch to CUs within the run-reconstruction model. As a result, we did not consider recruitment time-series to be reliable enough to estimate stock-recruitment based benchmarks such as S\textsubscript{MSY} and S\textsubscript{gen}. We did however use spawner recruit model fits to provide approximate estimates of CU-level productivity, which are used to inform the application of percentile-based benchmarks.


@vanwillInnerSouthCoast2014 provides more details on the data sources, infilling procedures and run reconstruction, which were reproduced for this study. We did not include the Lower Fraser or Fraser Canyon Chum CUs. More details can be found in Appendix \@ref(app:appendix-chum). We removed three systems with extensive enhancement (Qualicum River and Little Qualicum River from spawning channels, and Puntledge River from hatchery production, all within the Georgia Strait CU). It is assumed that the enhanced contribution to spawning was near 100% for these systems.

## CU STATUS ESTIMATION

For this case study, we consider two approaches for characterizing CU status: 
(1) Multidimensional algorithm within the Pacific Salmon Scanner Tool, or Salmon Scanner (Pestal et al. in prep.) and 
(2) CU-level abundance relative to a percentile lower benchmark. <!--SG: This could also come from the scanner, if you have a BM, you put that into the tool and estimate this separately.
LW: The Scanner as we used it also has the absolute benchmark of 1500 / 10,000 fish. Although the percentile status can be calculated within the Salmon Scanner, the point in the paper is to compare the scanner with a simpler approach that won't be new for people. The Scanner uses additional metrics/benchmarks (e.g., absolute spawners against 1500/10,000), and this comparison of percentile approach vs Scanner shows how sensitive LRPs and assessments against LRP are to the additional metrics in the Scanner. -->


The first approach is consistent with Canada's WSP and is recommended by Holt et al. (in review)<!--^[Holt *et. al.* Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units. CSAS Working Paper. In review]--> as the method that should be used to estimate CU status when using the CU status-based LRP approach. The second approach is presented for comparison with the multidimensional approach.<!--SG: Again, it isn’t really a separate approach.  The Scanner does both. You are just doing what we would recommend in an expert driven process. Look at the integrated status produced by the algorithm, and results for individual metrics, time series, etc. Our work has landed on the algorithm we have as the best way. LW: See above comment. -->


When applying the multidimensional algorithm used within the Salmon Scanner to ISC Chum, we used percentile benchmarks when they were available for a CU. For CUs in which percentile benchmarks were not appropriate, the multidimensional algorithm used trends in spawner abundance as a basis for assessing CU status (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree)).  As a result, both of our approaches to CU status estimation depend at least partially on percentile benchmarks.


Percentile benchmarks can be applied to assess status of CUs when other data - like benchmarks based on productivity or habitat - are not available or reliable [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018; @clarkEvaluationPercentileApproach2014]. The suitability of percentile benchmarks was evaluated for ISC Chum by @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018, who tested how well percentile benchmarks matched benchmarks from stock-recruit parameters, using retrospective and simulation analyses. @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 also calculated benchmarks based on stock-recruit model parameters for ISC Chum CUs, but did not recommend them due to uncertainty in spawner and recruit data. They tested how well a 25% percentile benchmark (and higher values up to 50%) compared to estimates of S\textsubscript{gen} for these CUs. They found that percentile benchmarks (from 25-50%) under moderate to high harvest rates and low to moderate productivity tended to underestimate 'true' S\textsubscript{gen} values (estimated from the same data), which would lead to optimistic and incorrect status assessments. More work on alternatives to percentile benchmarks were needed in this case.


For this case study, percentile benchmarks were calculated using the raw infilled time series of annual escapement (i.e., not smoothed). In contrast, status for year $i$ was determined by comparing the generational mean (geometric mean on a 4 year window, ending with year $i$) spawner abundance with the benchmark. This approach of using raw (unsmoothed) escapements when calculating benchmarks, and generational smoothed escapements when estimating CU status relative to benchmarks, is consistent with the approaches taken for our other two case studies for proortional LRPs.

Based on recommendations in @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 (Table \@ref(tab:holt-tab6)), Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet fall in the category of using 25% as a lower benchmark and 50% as an upper benchmark (Ricker $\alpha$ 2.5-4, harvest rate 20-40%). Loughborough, Northeast Vancouver Island, and Upper Knight ($\alpha$ 1.5-2.5 and harvest rate 0-20%) had a 50% lower and upper benchmark recommended. Bute Inlet ($\alpha$ 1.5-2.5, harvest rate 20-40%) needed further evaluation and percentile benchmarks were not recommended. Percentile benchmarks were also not recommended for Southern Coastal Streams due to low productivity ($\alpha$ <1.5; Table \@ref(tab:CU-summary)). 


The methods for multidimensional assessments within the Salmon Scanner are described in Section \@ref(MethodsChapter). In applying the multidimensional approach to ISC Chum, we used percentile benchmarks as recommended in @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 for lower and upper benchmarks for the five CUs that have appropriate percentiles benchmarks identified (as described above). Percentile benchmarks were not available for Bute Inlet and Southern Coastal Streams, in which case the multidimensional algorithm used trends to assess CU status (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree)).


## LRP ESTIMATION: CU STATUS BASED


### Methods

To derive CU status-based LRPs, we calculated the proportion of CUs that had status estimates above the Red zone (or, above the lower percentile benchmark). As with the Interior Fraser Coho and WCVI Chinook case studies, we required all CUs to be above the Red zone for the ISC Chum SMU to be classified as being above the LRP. 


The single-metric approach to assessing CU status based on percentiles has specific data requirements [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018] while the multidimensional approach can be applied to any CU with at least a consistent time-series of spawner abundances. <!--SG: Again, they are the same…Scanner can use percentiles as BM. LW: see above comment -->To compare LRPs based on CU assessment from these two approaches we compared data subsets including those that used the same data for each method, and all appropriate data for each method. We evaluated six different combinations of data and LRP methods (Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios)).

When describing ISC Chum LRP scenarios in Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios) and throughout this case study, we use the following labeling convention: *Metric : CU Status Method : Data Scenario*. 'Metric' refers to the choice to base all ISC Chum LRPs on the proportion of CUs above Red CU status (Prop). The 'CU Status Method' can be based on the multidimensional algorithm within the Salmon Scanner (Scanner) or on a single percentile benchmark used to characterize CU status (Percentile).  Finally, 'Data Scenario' labels indicate both the number of CUs represented (4, 5, or 7) and the completeness of the time series (Full or Partial). 'Full' scenarios only included CUs with complete time series (no CUs with missing years). 'Partial' scenarios included CUs with incomplete time series (years that did not have observations in those CUs were omitted). When using percentile benchmarks in these scenarios, we used percentiles based on @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018. The benchmarks were estimated using the entire time series. 


For Scenarios 2 and 4 in Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios), we used CU status based on percentile benchmarks that are determined by productivity and historical exploitation, as outlined in @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018. This method used annual escapement values to calculate benchmarks and the generational mean of escapement (geometric mean over 4 years) to assess status in each year. Scenario 2 includes the four CUs that had complete time series (observations in each year, no CU-level infilling) and that also had appropriate percentile benchmarks (Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios)). For example, Upper Knight was excluded because it did not have a complete time series, Southern Coastal Streams was excluded because it does not have an appropriate percentile benchmark, and Bute Inlet was excluded for both of these reasons. We then relaxed this requirement for all CUs to have data in all years and included all CUs that meet the constraints of @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 even if they had missing data for some years (Scenario 4). This scenario included Upper Knight in some years, which meant that it had five CUs in some years and four in others. Thus, the power to detect Red status varied among years in Scenario 4, using more of the available data than Scenario 2.  

For Scenarios 1, 3, 5 and 6 in Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios), we used status based on the multidimensional algorithm within the Salmon Scanner. To compare results between status on a single metric (abundance relative to percentile benchmarks) and the multidimensional approach, we applied the multidimensional algorithm to the same two data sets used for percentiles, i.e., using same CUs and years. For examples, Scenarios 1 and 2 use the same data, and Scenarios 3 and 4 use the same data. Because the multidimensional assessments do not require abundance-based benchmarks to assign status, this method could also be used for CUs that did not have appropriate percentile benchmarks (Southern Coastal Streams and Bute Inlet). Scenario 5 only included CUs with a full time series, and Scenario 6 included Upper Knight and Bute Inlet, which had some missing years. 


### Results

**CU Status Based on the Multidimensional Approach within the Salmon Scanner**

Using the CU status based on the multidimensional approach within the Salmon Scanner, two out of five CUs with data in the most recent year of data (2018) would be above their lower benchmark (Amber or Green zone) and three would be below (Red zone; Figure \@ref(fig:chum-CU-status-tree)). Over the time series, status for Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet and Georgia Strait has improved, while status in other CUs has declined or switched from Green to Red several times.

**CU Status Based on Percentile Benchmarks**

Two out of four CUs were below their percentile lower benchmark in 2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-perc-status-static)). Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet and Georgia Strait had status above their lower benchmarks, and Upper Knight did not have observations in 2018. Status for North East Vancouver Island and Loughborough was occasionally above the Red zone before the 2000s, but has been mainly Red for the past $\sim$ 20 years. Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet have been above Red status in every since $\sim$ 1970. Upper Knight has been mainly Red status except for two short periods in in the 1960s and 1970s, and did not have any observations since 2004.

In supplementary analyses, we evaluated percentile benchmarks retrospectively for each year in the time series using only data prior to that year. As more years of data were included, percentile benchmarks increased over time for Georgia Strait (especially the 50^th^ percentile) and had modest increases for Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-perc-retro)). Percentile benchmarks decreased by a small amount for Loughborough and North East Vancouver Island. Southern Coastal Stream shows evidence of shifting baselines, as the percentiles decrease over time following a general decline in abundances (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-perc-retro)). Upper Knight also shows this pattern but to a lesser extent.




## LRP ESTIMATION: AGGREGATE ABUNDANCE LOGISTIC REGRESSION LRPS

### Methods

We evaluated whether the proportion of CUs above their lower benchmark could be predicted by aggregate abundance using logistic regression models. We tested this using percentile benchmarks. While we initially considered logistic regression LRPs that used S~gen~ as a lower CU benchmark instead of percentiles, we decided to drop this approach due to unreliable  stock-recruit data. Using recruitment data would not satisfy reliability principles in Holt et al. (in review). These methods used four CUs with over 50 years of data and appropriate percentile benchmarks (North East Vancouver Island, Loughborough, Georgia Strait, and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet). Aggregate abundance (predictor variable) was calculated using only these four CUs. We omitted Bute Inlet and Upper Knight (both had CU-level infilling in recent years) and Southern Coastal Streams (no appropriate percentile benchmark). Refer to Section \@ref(MethodsChapter) for more details. 


Due to poor logistic model fits using the entire 1953-2018 time series, we did not conduct retrospective analyses of logistic regression LRPs for this SMU as was done for the Interior Fraser River Coho case study. The characteristics of the data that led to poor logistic model fits are highlighted in the results section below. 


Projection LRPs are an alternative aggregate abundance LRP that we did not consider for this SMU due to lack of reliable stock-recruitment parameter estimates for component CUs. However, this approach could be considered in future analyses given consensus on model structure and parameterization that provide realistic uncertainties in projections of population dynamics.


### Results

The logistic model predicting whether all CUs were above their benchmark based on aggregate abundance fit the data poorly (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-logistic-perc)). The sum of abundance for all CUs in a given year was not a good predictor of whether those CUs were above their benchmarks in that year. Years with high aggregate abundance but with some CUs below their benchmark make a logistic model unsuitable for the purpose of estimating which aggregate abundance is linked to a high probability of each component CU being above its lower benchmark.  

The diagnostics for the logistic regression indicated that the model fit was poor  (Table \@ref(tab:logistic-diag-chum), Figure \@ref(fig:chum-logistic-perc)). Pseudo $R^2$ was low (0.03), indicating a poor fit. The Box-Tidwell test indicated a significant lack of linearity in the relationship between aggregate abundance and log-odds (p-value = 0.02), which means that the assumption that the relationship between aggregate abundance and log-odds is linear was not met. Including aggregate abundance in the model did not improve fit over the null model based on a Goodness of fit p-value of 0.13 (>0.05). The ratio of correct classifications (above below LRP) relative to all classification was 0.7 based an LRP at p=0.5. Note that this method tends to have overly optimistic values when the data used to fit the logistic model and to evaluate classification accuracy are the same. The Wald p-value was not significant for $B_{1}$ (p=0.19, the coefficient for aggregate abundances). There was no evidence of outliers or autocorrelation in residual deviations. Despite meeting the last two assumptions (no autocorrelation or outliers), they were not enough to overcome the deficiencies identified by the other diagnostic criteria.  Therefore, logistic regression LRPs are not presented here.

Several factors led to these poor model fits. The Inside South Coast Chum SMU is made up of seven CUs that vary in their escapement abundance. In many years, escapement in Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet is greater than in other CUs by two orders of magnitude (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-distribution)). In addition, the correlation in escapement among these seven CUs is low (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-corr)). These characteristics mean that the aggregate abundance may be high due to one or more CUs with high escapements, while one more smaller CUs are below their benchmark. High aggregate escapements do not mean that all CUs are above their benchmark. The low pairwise correlations in CU escapements are likely due to the SMU covering a large area, with varying numbers of populations affected by both local and regional factors, as described in Sectoin \@ref(chum-context).

In a preliminary retrospective analysis, the logistic model fits were more appropriate using a truncated portion of the data that ended in the 1980s. Although logistic regression may be used to estimated LRPs based on aggregate abundance in SMUs where abundance is more even among CUs and escapements are more correlated, these relationships may not remain static and could break down over time.


## HISTORICAL EVALUATION OF STATUS ACROSS LRP METHODS

The ISC Chum SMU was consistently below the LRP for large portions of the historical time series, regardless of LRP estimation method  (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare)). While the aggregate abundance of the SMU increased over time, SMU status remained below the LRP in every year of the past two decades except 2004 for all estimation methods. These results were mainly due to the tendency of Georgia Strait and Burrard Inlet-Howe Sound CUs to have high and increasing abundances while smaller CUs, such as North East Vancouver Island, Loughborough, and Southern Coastal Streams, remained low (Figures \@ref(fig:chum-perc-status-static), \@ref(fig:chum-escapement-infill)).


```{r chum-LRP-compare, fig.cap="Comparison of LRP status (red = below LRP, gray = above LRP) for six scenarios. The black line shows aggregate abundance. Scenarios 1-3 and 6 do not include Bute Inlet or Southern Coastal Streams (no appropriate percentile benchmarks).

When using the same data, LRP status based on a single metric on abundances relative to percentile benchmarks and the multidimensional approach within the Salmon Scanner were identical (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare)). This result can be seen by comparing Scenario 1 and 2 and Scenario 3 and 4. These identical results occur because all CUs in Scenarios 1-4 have percentile benchmarks and never drop below 1500 fish, which means that the multidimensional approach relies on percentile benchmarks to assess CU status for all CUs in all years. If some CUs did not have percentile benchmarks, requiring trends to be used instead, or if their absolute abundances dropped below 1500 spawners, then the two approaches could have led to different results.


In this case study, adding more data changed the number of years that the SMU was below the LRP. Scenario 6 (most data) had the most years below the LRP, with every year after the first being below the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare), Table \@ref(tab:LRP-scenarios)). A comparison of Scenarios 2 and 4, which are both based on percentile benchmarks, shows that including more data (Scenario 4) results in more years below the LRP. A comparison of Scenarios 5 and 6 (Salmon Scanner), shows that including more observations results in one year switching from above the LRP to below it, with the addition of data from two CUs with partial time series. Finally, a comparison of Scenarios 4 and 6 (where Scenario 6 had two more CUs than Scenario 4), shows that three years switched from above the LRP to below, as the two CUs without percentile benchmarks are added.


We found that SMU status can be below the LRP even if the aggregate abundance increases (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare)). For ISC Chum, this is mainly due to years with high abundances of Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet and low abundances and Red status in other, smaller CUs, such as Southern Coastal Streams. The moderate correlation in spawner abundances in Georgia Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet exacerbates this pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-corr)). This highlights the importance of including metrics of status at the CU level, which influence the overall SMU status.  


## DISCUSSION


As a data-limited SMU, the ISC Chum case study had unique characteristics to inform the guidelines for LRP development. We found that only the CU status-based LRP were applicable to this SMU, which is based on individual CU status. Because there were no reliable stock-recruit parameter estimates, we relied on data-limited methods to estimate CU status. We assessed CU status based on abundance relative to percentile benchmarks alone, or on a combination of percentiles and trends<!--LW: also uses 1500 and 10000 fish thresholds, just didn't get below 1500 fish--> using the multidimensional algorithm within the Salmon Scanner. The use of the multidimensional algorithm was particularly valuable because percentile benchmarks were not appropriate for two of the CUs (Bute Inlet and Southern Coastal Streams, Table  \@ref(tab:CU-summary)). Missing data also required decisions to be made about which CUs to include in which years. We used this case study to explore how sensitive CU status-based LRPs were to the decisions on number of CUs, and years of data to include in the analysis.


Using a multidimensional approach allowed us to include two CUs that did not have appropriate percentile benchmarks (Bute Inlet and Southern Coastal Streams). It allowed all seven CUs to be included when assessing SMU status by allowing alternative trend-based metrics to be considered. The seven-CU partial case provided the most pessimistic status of the scenarios considered as this approach used the most data. It resulted with the most years of the SMU being below the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare)). This multidimensional approach is especially useful for SMUs with a mix of data qualities and benchmark types, including those with and without relative abundance benchmarks. Like any approach to assess LRPs, the underlying data, and benchmarks applied (if abundance benchmarks can be used) should be verified by experts. In its current form, the multidimensional algorithm within th Salmon Scanner relies on whether abundance is $<$ 0.79$\times$ the long-term geometric average and whether abundances are $>$ 1500 in the absence of abundance-based benchmarks. It is worth noting that this long-term geometric average may also be sensitive to shifting baselines. This is another reason for experts to thoroughly review the data before any status assessment is made. 



This case study highlighted requirements and limitations of percentile benchmarks on data-limited CUs. Shifting baselines are one of the challenges of applying this method. If abundance has decreased over time, the resulting percentile benchmark will also decrease as more data is included (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-perc-retro)). This can arise from a decrease in abundance in the period of data or by an unrecorded high level of abundance before the period of data followed by a decrease before data are available. Thus, a CU with low abundance could be Green status based on the current benchmark, but would be Red using a benchmark with data before decreases in abundance. The result is an overly optimistic view of current status that does not reflect the reality of long-term declines. Two CUs (Southern Coastal Streams and Upper Knight) showed evidence of shifting baselines as abundances decreased over the last several decades (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-perc-retro)). Decreasing productivity can exacerbate this pattern. As productivity decreases, a larger abundance of spawners would be required to produce the same number of recruits. Experts should thoroughly review historical abundance data and determine where shifting baselines may be occurring, and can adjust benchmarks accordingly. In some cases it may be appropriate to choose benchmarks based on historical data or information prior to declines to avoid shifting baselines [@holtCautionsUsingPercentilebased2015]. Thus, while they are useful for CUs that lack reliable stock-recruit information, they cannot be used universally on data-limited CUs. 


Existing guidelines and cautions should be incorporated into any LRP analysis using percentile benchmarks. We followed guidelines from @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018 and did not use percentile benchmarks for CUs with low productivity and high exploitation rate (Tables \@ref(tab:CU-summary), \@ref(tab:holt-tab6)). In their simulation study, percentile-based benchmarks overestimated status with harvest rates >40% and $\alpha$ <4, or harvest rates 20-40% and $\alpha$ <2.5. In these cases of low productivity and high harvest rates, more exploration could be done on alternative benchmarks. These could include benchmarks based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge, habitat availability, or other information. If productivity and/or harvest is unknown, low contrast in escapement time-series could be indicators of cases where percentile benchmarks may not be appropriate [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. We also note that cases with identical lower and upper benchmarks carry the risk of moving immediately from Green to Red status with time in the Amber status zone (North East Vancouver Island, Upper Knight, Loughborough, Table \@ref(tab:CU-summary)). CUs with shorter time series also have the risk of unreliable percentile benchmarks. Confidence intervals for percentile benchmarks can also be derived by bootstrapping escapement data, accounting for autocorrelation in time-series [@peacockEvaluatingConsequencesCommon2020; @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018].


@clarkEvaluationPercentileApproach2014 applied a similar percentile-based approach for Alaskan salmon populations, where applicability of percentiles was categorized in into 3 tiers based on contrast in spawner abundances, harvest rate, and precision of escapement data. They tested the suitability of this tiered approach with theoretical, simulation, and meta-analysis methods using 76 stock-recruitment data sets from Alaska covering all 5 species of Pacific salmon. The goal of these tiers was to choose a Sustainable Escapement Goal (SEG; an upper and lower percentile) as a proxy for keeping escapement within a range that includes S\textsubscript{MSY} [@clarkEvaluationPercentileApproach2014]. Moving to British Columbia, @hilbornBritishColumbiaChum2012 adopted the percentile-based thresholds for evaluating the status of Inside South Coast Chum in BC for the purpose of certification with the Marine Stewardship Council [@hilbornBritishColumbiaChum2012]. 


Percentile benchmarks are used differently in Alaska and BC. In BC, percentiles are used at the CU scale, while in Alaska they are applied to each river [@mckinleyReviewSalmonEscapement2020]. ISC chum includes 296 streams among the seven CUs, with 126 in Strait of Georgia alone. Aggregating over river systems within CUs ignores the distribution of spawning within the CU and may not capture the loss of some less productive streams, rivers, or sub-populations within the CU. This risk is especially relevant in this case study because the data is infilled assuming correlation in spawning escapement within CUs.

An additional source of uncertainty stems from spawner time series that may include the influence of enhancement, which introduces the risk of inflating wild spawner numbers and providing an overly optimistic status assessments. We removed three systems that are highly enhanced (Qualicum and Little Qualicum from spawning channels, and Puntledge from a hatchery) before infilling stream escapements, but hatchery influence may impact time-series for the remaining systems through production and/or straying [@lynchAssessmentEnhancedChum2020].


We showed that increasing the number of CUs included in CU status-based LRP status assessment gave a more pessimistic status. This is not surprising given the low correlation of CUs within this SMU; we do not expect CUs to be interchangeable. Therefore, using as much data as possible will provide more realistic assessments of status, where those data are reliable. For this SMU where the status of two data-limited CUs, Upper Knight and Bute Inlet, cannot be inferred from data-rich CUs (see Section \@ref(chum-context)), omitting the data-limited CUs from analyses can result in either an SMU status that is data deficient or below the LRP depending on status of remaining data-rich CUs. When the status of at least one of the data-rich CUs is in the Red zone, the CU status-based LRP of 100% of CUs above the Red zone is considered breached. However, if the status of all data-rich CUs are above the Red zone, the SMU is considered data deficient if status of data-limited CUs is unknown because it cannot be inferred. In our case, we could assess status based on trends for these data-limited CUs as applied in the Salmon Scanner. However, in other SMUs, there may be cases where data to estimate trends are not available.


We were not able to estimate aggregate abundance logistic regression LRPs for ISC Chum due to poor model fits of the underlying data. The data were not suited to logistic regression, and aggregate abundance was not a good predictor of the status of component CUs. Abundance for two CUs was regularly two orders of magnitude larger than the smaller CUs (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-distribution)), and correlation in abundances between CUs was generally low (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-corr)). Thus, aggregate abundance can be high mainly due to high abundance CUs while low abundance CUs have Red status, and the SMU is thus below the LRP. This pattern is exacerbated because the two most abundant CUs have the highest correlation in escapement with each other, and generally low correlation with the other CUs (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-spawner-corr)). This pattern is also the reason why SMU status can be below the LRP even as aggregate abundances increase (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-LRP-compare)). The large geographical range of the SMU, different numbers of populations within each CU, and variation in productivity, threats, and ecosystem conditions help explain these characteristics of the data.


The CUs that were missing observations in some years and required CU-level infilling (Upper Knight and Bute Inlet) were not used in the aggregate abundance LRP analysis because the assumption that escapement is correlated between CUs ignores diversity between CUs and the potential for uncorrelated escapements. Unlike CU status-based LRPs, we did not consider status based on the multidimensional algorithm in the Salmon Scanner for aggregate abundance LRPs. It should also be noted that Upper Knight and Bute Inlet do not represent a random subset of the seven CUs in the Inside South Coast Chum SMU due to their location, watershed characteristics, near-shore marine environment, threats, and environmental conditions (Section \@ref(chum-context)).
