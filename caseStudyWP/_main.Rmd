# INTRODUCTION

-	This document supports the development of guidelines for defining LRPs for Pacific Salmon, as required by the recently revised Fisheries Act.  Guidelines that have been informed by this work are available in the companion working paper “Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units”.     

-	Under the New Fisheries Act, Limit Reference Points (LRPs) that represent the level below which serious harm is occurring will be required for major fish stocks prescribed in regulation.  For Pacific salmon, it is anticipated there could be > 65 major fish stocks (or stock management units, SMUs), where the proposed functional definition of a SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status.  

-	While lower biological benchmarks under the Wild Salmon Policy delineate abundances below which CUs are considered at risk of extinction (DFO 2005), these benchmarks have not been identified for many data-limited CUs and have not been aggregated to the SMU level, representing significant gaps in our ability to develop LRPs under the Fisheries Act.

-	The suite of LRP estimation methods considered in this paper are specific to the case where a LRP is defined as a single aggregate abundance that is associated with a high probability of all component CUs being above lower benchmarks that are consistent with the WSP.  Alternative approaches to identifying LRPs are discussed in t

-	The overall goal of this working paper is demonstrate and evaluate LRPs for 3 case study stock management units. For each case study, the set of LRP estimation methods considered is a function of available data and previously developed assessment methods for the SMU.

-	In retrospective analyses, our objective is to demonstrate the sensitivity of the LRP to the removal of years or CUs to inform guidance about minimum numbers of years or CUs

-	In simulation  evaluation, our objectives are to:
    i. Identify the bias in LRP estimates by comparing LRP estimated from observed data to “true” LRP estimated from “true” population dynamics (without observation error)
    i. How robust are LRPs to different underlying scenarios (model formulations, covariance in CU dynamics, observation errors, time varying productivity and capacity)?
    i.  How does LRP (and 95% CIs) vary with the number of years and proportion of CUs (and trade-offs), relative to the “true” LRP that includes all years and data?

-	Estimates presented in this paper are not meant to be definitive LRPs, which require more thorough review of data and their use here with local analysts and partners. These case studies demonstrate various approaches for developing LRPs.

# LRP ESTIMATION METHODS

In this section, we provide an overview of methods used to develop LRPs for our three case studies. Detailed methods specific to each case study are provided in Sections 3 (Interior Fraser Coho), 4 (WCVI Chinook), and 5 (South Coast Chum, excluding Fraser). 

All LRP estimation methods first require the status of individual CUs with with an SMU to be assessed as being above or below a lower benchmark. The distribution of CU-level status estimates within a CU is then used as a basis for defining an LRP using the methods described in sections 2.1 - 2.??.

Under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP), the lower benchmark is defined as a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer
between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being
considered at risk of extinction.  A variety of methods are available for estimating lower benchmarks depending on species and data availability (citation needed).  A more thorough discussion of available benchmarks, as well as how these relate to WSP Integrated Status Assessments, is provided in the companion working paper *Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units* (Holt et al. in review).

An overview of CU benchmarks and LRP estimation methods examined for each case study is provided in Table \@ref(tab:csOverview).

## PROPORTION-BASED LRPS

### Proportion of CUs above lower abundance benchmarks


### Proportion of CUs with multi-dimensional status > red


## AGGREGATE ABUDNANCE-BASED LRPS

### Logistic regression LRPs

*Question: I am suggesting that we call these "Logistic Regression LRPs" instead of "Empirical LRPs". This is because if we end up using simple proportions of CUs > lower benchmarks as a LRP, these will also be empirical. What do others think?  Other ideas??* *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: I like Logistic Regression LRPs, it's intuitive. Another option could be Aggregate LRPs?}*

Logistic regression LRPs are derived from an empirically estimated relationship between CU-level status and aggregate SMU abundance. Using this approach, the LRP represents the aggregate abundance that has historically been associated with a pre-specified probability of a given proportion of CUs being above their lower benchmarks. For illustrative purposes, we assume that all CUs are required to be above their lower benchmarks. For each year of observed data, CU-level status is quantified as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have $S_i > LBM_i$ and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have $S_i > LBM_i$. A logistic regression is then fit to predict the probability that all CUs will have $S_i > LBM_i$ as a function of aggregate spawner abundance to the SMU using the logistic regression equation:

\begin{equation}
  \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = B_0 + B_1 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t}
   (\#eq:logistic)
\end{equation}

where, $p$ is probability, $B_0$ and $B_1$ are estimated logistic regression parameters and $S_{i,t}$ is spawner abundance to CU $i$ in year $t$. Equation \@ref(eq:logistic) is then re-arranged calculate the LRP as the aggregate spawner abundance associated with the pre-specified probability threshold of $p^*$,

\begin{equation}
  LRP = \frac{log(\frac{p^*}{1-p^*}) - B_0}{B_1}
  (\#eq:logisticLRP)
\end{equation}


An example logistic regression fit for the proportional approach is shown in Figure x. We show the estimation of LRPs based on this fit for two possible probability thresholds: $p^*$ = 50% and $p^*$ = 90%. LRP estimates therefore represent the aggregate abundance that is associated with a 50%, or 95%, probability of all CUs having $S_i > LBM_i$. Alternative $p^*$ values are presented in case-study applications below.


#### LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL DIAGNOSTICS

*To be added by Carrie*


### PROJECTION-BASED LRPS


Projected LRPs are estimated using stochastic projections of future stock size for individual CUs. Projected abundances are then used to characterize the implicit relationship between aggregate spawner abundance for the SMU and the probability that the required proportion of CUs will be above their individual lower abundance benchmarks (e.g. Sgen). 

We used the samSim modelling tool to conduct stochastic projections for our case study applications. samSim is an R package that was developed to quantify recovery potential for Pacific salmon populations (Holt et al. 2020; Freshwater et al. 2020). The code for samSim is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim.  We created a modified version of samSim to support LRP estimation, which is also available on GitHub: https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP  
Updated functionality for the LRP version of samSim include:
* The option to sample stock recruitment parameter sets directly from an estimated Bayesian joint posterior distribution
* The addition of a stock recruitment function that includes an environmental co-variate, as well as specification of future variability in the environmental co-variate (required for Interior Fraser Coho case study; see Section x.x for more details)
* The option to initialize population dynamics for individual CUs at unfished equilibrium when no historical recruitment data are available. Note that while this option would not be appropriate for projections aimed at estimating recovery from a current state, it can be used to estimate projection-based LRPs because we are only interested in the underlying relationship between aggregate abundance and the probability individual CUs will be above their lower benchmark.

We incorporate uncertainty in key biological and management parameters that control CU dynamics into samSim through the specification of empirically-derived probability distributions.  Uncertainties represented this way include stock-recruitment parameters, age-at-maturity, and exploitation rates, as well uncertainty in the level of covariation in these processes among CUs.  Larger structural uncertainties in underlying data or model formulation were represented through the use of alternative operating models (OMs), with each OM intended to represent a plausible hypothesis about future stock dynamics. The selection of relevant OMs to be considered varied among case studies based on available data and knowledge.  

Multiple sets of projections were undertaken for each OM; each with a different fixed exploitation rate strategy applied (including a no fishing strategy). This approach provided good contrast in projected dynamics over all scenarios ....   

Observation error was not incorporated into forward projections because we ......

# CASE STUDY 1: INTERIOR FRASER COHO SALMON

## CONTEXT

The Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes Coho Salmon that return to the Fraser River and tributaries upstream of Hell’s Gate in the Fraser Canyon.Declines in spawner abundance throughout the 1990’s led to a suite of management actions to promote recovery, including significant fishery restrictions (Decker et al. 2014). Interior Fraser Coho have also been assessed twice by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) since 2002.  The most recent COSEWIC assessment classified the Interior Fraser Coho Designatable Unit (DU) as having “Threatened” status (COSEWIC 2016). In response to this listing, DFO has undertaken a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) for Interior Fraser Coho that describes status, habitat, threats and limiting factors, candidate recovery targets, and abundance projections for the DU, as well as recommendations regarding mitigation and allowable harm (Arbeider et al. 2020). Our data and analysis methods borrow heavily from this recent RPA work.

In addition to COSEWIC status assessments, Interior Fraser Coho were assessed under the framework of DFO’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) in 2014. Five WSP Conservation Units (CUs) have been identified for of Interior Fraser Coho: Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, Lower Thompson, North Thompson, and South Thompson (DFO 2015).  The 2014 WSP Integrated Status Assessment classified three of these CUs as being amber status (Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, South Thompson) and the remaining two CUs as amber/green status (Lower Thompson, North Thompson; DFO 2015).  

We consider two types of CU benchmark when developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs for Interior Fraser Coho. The first type is the WSP lower benchmark of Sgen, where Sgen is the number of spawners required to recover to SMSY (spawners maximum sustainable yield) within one generation, under equilibrium conditions in the absence of fishing (Holt et al. 2009). 

The second type is based on a short-term recovery target identified by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006), in which CU status is based on the distribution of spawning escapement among sub-populations nested within CUs (Table \@ref(tab:cohoCU2SP)). This benchmark is specific to the Interior Fraser Coho SMU. We have retained it as part of this case study to maintain consistency with previous work.

## DATA

Data for this case study covered brood years 1998-2014 (return years 2001-2018). Data prior to 1998 were not used due to concerns about inconsistent assessment methods and data quality.  

Data for the 1998-2013 brood years were taken from the 2018 Interior Fraser Coho RPA report (Appendix 4 of Arbeider et al. 2020), while one additional year of data (2014 brood year) was provided by DFO’s Fraser River Stock Assessment Unit (M. Arbeider, pers. comm., 2020).Detailed descriptions of data treatments, assumptions, and data quality are provided in Arbeider et al. (2020). Data used for our analyses included (i) annual spawner abundance by CU, (ii) annual recruits-at-age by CU, (iii) a hatchery-based smolt-to-adult survival rate index, and (iv) annual spawner abundances for 11 sub-populations nested within the 5 CUs.

  - Caveats: e.g., recruitment estimated using common ER for all CUs; review Arbeider et al. for additional data caveats


## METHODS

### Empirical LRPs

We evaluate two empirical (data-based) approaches for developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs for Interior Fraser Coho. Both approaches estimate LRPs by fitting logistic regression models to historically observed data; they differ in the metric used to represent CU-level status relative to CU-level lower benchmarks. 

The first approach uses a distributional benchmark to characterize CU status, which is based on the short-term recovery target identified by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006). The recovery target is that “the 3-year geometric average, natural-origin escapement in at least half of the subpopulations within each of the five CUs exceeds 1,000 spawning Coho Salmon, excluding hatchery fish spawning in the wild”. Based on this target, CU status in a given year is quantified as the proportion of sub-populations with escapement above 1000 fish. The “half of sub-populations within each CU” threshold required 2 out of 3 sub-populations to be above 1000 fish for the North Thompson and South Thompson CUs, 1 out of 2 sub-populations to be above 1000-fish for the Lower Thompson and Middle Fraser CU, and the only sub-population in the Fraser Canyon to be above 1000 fish to satisfy this target. CU-level status based on these distributional benchmarks then gets rolled-up into an SMU-level LRP using a logistic regression analysis described in section x above. 

- Still to add: 
  - proportional vs. probability-based logistic regression?  threshold p*?
  - logistic penalty used

The second approach uses Sgen to characterize CU status.Four different formulations of stock recruitment model are used to estimate Sgen based on previous analyses. Key differences among the formulations centre around whether a hierarchical model structure is used when estimating Sgen and whether an informative prior distribution is applied to the spawner abundance level at which the stock replaced itself (SRep).    

- Still to add:
  - more details on 4 SRR models (incl. equations)
  - proportional vs. probability-based logistic regression?  threshold p*?
  - logistic penalty used

# CASE STUDY 3: INSIDE SOUTH COAST CHUM - NON-FRASER

[//]: # Add a comment in colour: *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: some text}*

## CONTEXT

The Inside South Coast Chum Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes seven Conservation Units (CU) of chum salmon from rivers that drain into Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea along the mainland of British Columbia and the east coast of Vancouver Island (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-map); @holtby_conservation_2007). This area includes deep fjords, glaciers, large rivers, and small coastal streams. 

@holt_evaluating_2018 used these CUs to compare benchmarks from stock-recruit relationships and benchmarks based on abundance, as a case study for chum populations with limited data. They showed that benchmarks based on a percentile of abundances can be comparable to those based on stock-recruit relationships when productivity is relatively high and harvest is relatively low. In other cases, percentile benchmarks may be inappropriate because they do not account for shifting baselines. 

We chose Inside South Coast Chum as a case study because:

- Previous work on comparing stock-recruit and percentile benchmarks to these CUs
- It is an example of a data-limited SMU, with:
  - incomplete escapement time series (not all streams counted each year, some CUs have no counts in some years)
  - recruits estimated using harvest, age, and escapement data, allowing stock-recruit modelling
  - no data on marine survival (although there are some scale/growth data in @debertin_marine_2017)
- Relatively long time series (1953-2018)
- Large area with many diverse watersheds, flow regimes, and ocean entry locations, contrasting with Interior Fraser Coho
- High contrast in abundances levels among CUs
- Low correlation in abundance levels among CUs over time

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figure/chum-map.png"))
```

## DATA

We used essentially the same data used in @holt_evaluating_2018, updated with escapement data up to 2018. @van_will_inner_2014 provides more details on the data sources, infilling procedures and run reconstruction, which were reproduced for this study and described below. We did not include the Lower Fraser or Fraser Canyon chum CUs. 

### Spawner counts / Escapement

We used spawning escapement data forom 1953-2018. Most of the escapement data comes from the NUSEDS database (a small amount from Lower Fraser Stock Assessment for Areas 28 and 29, FSC in-river catch from some First Nations, and enhanced escapement from DFO Salmon Enhancement Program) *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: probably unneccesary detail}*. The number of chum salmon spawners that return to spawn (escapement) is typcially counted using visual surveys.  Biologists from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and First Nations including ... (Island Marine Aquatic Working Group) *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: which ones?}* generate these data by walking streams and counting fish, *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: helicopter counts?}* and using fences or weirs on some rivers. Total escapement for each stream is usually a peak counts or estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) method.

### Fishery harvest, genetics, and age

The number of chum caught in fisheries in the Inside South Coast area were taken from the DFO Clockwork Database, which includes the DFO Fishery Operating System and Sales slip databases and Genetic Stock Identification data. Age distributions for each year were taken from the Johnstone Strait fishery aggregate, as age data for specific CUs or streams was not available. Harvest data was not available for 1954-2018 *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: confirm with Pieter Van Will why 1953 had no harvest data}*. Age composition data as available for 1958-2018.

### Data treatment

We removed the summer run fish as all the data in regards the reconstruction work is 
associated with populations that return in the fall.  

To get wild escapement, we kept only wild spawners, removing hatchery spawners, spawners harvested at a facility, and spawners collected for brood stock. 

We also removed spawners for the Qualicum River, Little Qualicum River, and Puntledge River, as these systems have been nearly 100% enhanced at least since enhancement began at these locations. We have little data in the enhanced contribution found in these returns but for the purposes of removing hatchery origin fish, we make the assumption that these streams had 100% hatchery origin spawners. 

After these removals, the steps for preparing the data for analysis were:

- Infill total and wild escapement by CU and Area, (by stream for CUs with observations, by CU for years with no observations in a CU)
- Run reconstruction: 
  - Add fishery catch by CU and Area to total escapement to estimate total returns / recruitment / stock *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: not sure which term to use here. Recruitment might be confusing since it is recruits in a spawning year, not for a brood year}*
  - Use proportion of wild:total escapement by CU and Area to estimate number of wild returns 
  - Use age proportions of catch to estimate age of returns and get recruits by brood year for each CU. Result is wild spawners and corresponding recruits by brood year for each CU

#### Infilling of spawner escapement data 

The data we used had years where not all streams were counted. When a CU had some streams counted in a year, we infilled by stream (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-escapement-infill)). When there were no counts of spawners for a CU in a given year, we infilled by CU for that year and CU. We had to infill by CU to get total spawners to use for the run reconstruction, but we did not use CUs with CU-level infilling in the retrospective analysis of LRPs, as it assumes that escapement is correlated between CUs in a given year. 

There were two puproses of infilling:

1. Infill total and wild escapement by CU and Area in order to get wild returns by CU and Area, in order to estimate recruits for each brood year.

2. Infill wild escapement by CU, in order to get a time series of wild escapement to use in retrospective analysis of LRPs.

##### Infilling by stream

This applies to CUs and years when there were counts in some streams in the CU in a given year. For each stream, the geometric mean of escapement over all years was calculated as the stream's average escapement. Then the total average escapement for each CU in each year was the sum of the average escapements from all streams. Then a proportion of monitored escapement in each year was the sum of average escapement of all streams with counts in a year divided by the sum of the average escapements for all streams (counted and uncounted) in that CU. The infilled escapement for a CU in given year was the sum of the observed escapements for that CU and year divided by the proportion of the monitored escapement for that CU and year. 

Infilling by stream typically made up a small proportion of the total escapement for each CU, with the exception of Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet. This was partly due to increasing escapements in the Cheakamus River and Indian River since 2000. 

This method assumes that escapement among streams is correlated, which is not always the case (can have figure in appendix or quote correlation values). 

##### Infilling by CU

If there were no counts of any streams in a CU in a given year, a second round of infilling was done with data set that had already been infilled by stream. This was the case for two CUs: Upper Knight (22 years: 1979-1980, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1991,1996,2004-18) and Bute Inlet (13 years: 2005-2006, 2008-2018). 

Using by-stream infilled escapement summed for each CU, the CUs and years with missing data were infilled assuming the total CU escapement was correlated between CUs. The procedure was similar to that for infilling by stream, but a geometric average for each CU across all years was used to calculate the proportion of the average for each year, and then that was used to estimate escapement for the two CUs with no obervations.

*\textcolor{cyan}{LW: This might be better in the discussion}* These CUs (Upper Knight and Bute Inlet) were not used for the retrospective analysis because the assumption that escapement is correlated between CUs ignores diversity between CUs and the potential for uncorrelated escapements. The reality of uncorrelated escapements must be taken into account to evaluate whether aggregate escapement is a meaningful predictor for the status of individual CUs. It should also be noted that these two CUs do not represent a random subset of the seven CUs in the Inside South Coast Chum SMU. Both have fewer streams than the other CUs and a higher proportion of summer-run populations of chum. These CUs also include long fjord systems with glaciers and watersheds that go deep into the mainland with headwaters in the Cariboo region. Environmental conditions including patterns of hydrology, geomorphology, and marine conditions when smolts enter the ocean in these systems may vary from that of the other five CUs, leading to differences in productivity and responses to the regional climate. For example, productivity (recruits per spawner) of the Upper Knight and Bute Inlet CUs (using CU-level infilling, which introduces error) have the largest magnitude of variability in the SMU, with very productive years (>100 recruits per spawner) and low productivity years, and boom and bust cycles of abundance. In other SMUs where the quality of data differs for a subset of CUs, careful consideration should be given to whether abundance, productivity, and their trends can be reliably estimated using data from CUs with data of higher quality.

#### Run reconstruction to estimate recruitment

We reconstructed the returns for each brood year to give recruits for brood years 1955-2012 (age composition data from 1958-2018, minimum fish age was 3 years, maximum fish age was 6 years). Using CU benchmarks based on stock-recruit parameters - in this case, Sgen - requires knowing the spawners and recruits (adult offspring produced by each brood year of spawners) for each brood year (spawning year). Estimating recruits requires knowing wild spawner escapement, number of wild fish caught in fisheries, and the age of these fish. 

To get these estimates, total (wild and hatchery origin) spawners based on the infilling methods above (both stream and CU level infilling) were calculated for each CU and Fishery Management Area (Figure \@ref(fig:chum-map)). The number of fish harvested in fisheries (wild and hatchery, by CU and Fishery Management Area) were added to the total escapement to get an estimate of totoal stock by CU and Fishery Management Area for each spawning year. This total stock number was multiplied by the proportion of wild spawners in each CU and Fishery Management Area based on the infilled wild and total spawner escapement. The product was an estimate of total wild stock (spawner escapement plus fishery harvest) by CU and Fishery Management Area for each brood year. Finally, the age composition of chum harvested in the Johnstone Strait aggregate fishery (ages 3, 4, 5 and 6) were used to assign fish from this total stock to brood years. As such, this analysis does not account for age diversity between CUs or streams.

Note that the two CUs requiring CU-level infilling correspond to only one Fishery Management Area each, which allows the run reconstruction using fishery harvest data at this level.

### Benchmarks for Conservation Units

*\textcolor{cyan}{LW: some of this might be better in the lit review/ guidelines working paper}*

- The Wild Salmon Policy requires that salmon Conservation Units have set benchmarks dividing three levels of health: red, amber, green.
- From @canada_canadas_2005: "The lower benchmark between Amber and Red will be established at a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a **substantial** buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC. The buffer will account for uncertainty in data and control of harvest management."

Level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC can be informed by several criteria:

- @holt_indicators_2009: Table 2
  - Spawner abundance
  - Time trends in spawner abundance
  - Distribution
  - Likelihood of continued trends in abundance given fishing effort
- @cosewic_cosewic_2019: Table 2
  - Decline in total number of mature individuals over last 10 years or 3 generations (whichever is longer) where reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood of may not be reversible, based on (and specifying) any of: 
      - direct observation
      - an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon
      - a decline in index of area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat
      - actual or potential levels of exploitation
      - the effects of introduced taxa, hybridization, pathogens, pollutants, competitors, or parasites
  - Reduction of $\geq$ 70% = endangered
  - reduction of $\geq$ 50% = threatened
- @iucn_standards_and_petitions_committee_guidelines_2019: Table 2.1
  - same as COSEWIC above, but uses "Vulnerable" instead of "Threatened"

How do these line up with LRPs?

- @government_of_canada_fishery_2009: A fishery decision-making framework incorporating the precautionary approach: 
  - "LRP represents the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock." 
  - "At this stock level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a lont-term loss of fishing opportunities"
  - "When developing reference points efforts should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available."

- @fisheries_and_oceans_canada_harvest_2006
  - "The Limit reference point is the stock level below which productivity is sufficiently impaired to cause serious harm to the resource but **above the level where the risk of extinction becomes a concern**" - Qualitatively similar to the benchmark between Red and Amber Zones in WSP. 
  
If each of the component CUs of a SMU is above the red/amber benchmark and thus not at risk of extinction, the entire SMU could judged to be above its LRP. 

### Appropriate benchmarks for Inside South Coast Chum:

Based on @government_of_canada_fishery_2009:
"When developing reference points efforts should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available."

Range of factors which may affect the productivity of Inside South Coast Chum:

- Ocean conditions:
  - Competition / Biomass of North American pink, sockeye, and chum salmon @debertin_marine_2017, @litz_competition_2021
  - Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (both positive and negative depending on what time period examined) @litz_competition_2021
  - North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) (positive relationship with growth), interaction between PDO and NPGO @debertin_marine_2017
  - Early marine entry temperature (inlets)
  - Timing of spring bloom
  - Ocean ecology during time at sea (zooplankton, forage fish available) - dependent on ocean temperature @cheng_upper_2021
- Interacting / carry-over / complex effects:
  - winter incubation temperatures -> earlier emergence -> potential mismatch with spring bloom Wilson 2021 thesis (chum outmigration getting earlier)
  - ocean conditions -> female adult size -> egg burial depth * scour flood frequency/intensity (climate change) * land cover (exacerbating factors of floods) -> lower egg to adult survival
  - female adult size -> egg size -> lower condition at estuary entry -> lower early marine survival
- Habitat loss
  - estuary loss (human, climate change)
  - change in quality of spawning habitat (change in sediment regime, possibly from forestry, landslides, potential climate change induced/exacerbated).
- Fishing mortality (Alaska, BC)
- Predation
- Depensation at low spawner abundance 
- Negative impacts of hatchery fish

From @holt_evaluating_2018: "Status assessments under the WSP integrate numerous metrics, including those on abundances, trends in abundance, and spatial distribution (Holt et al. 2009). Benchmarks on abundances (percentile or stock-recruitment based) are only one component of an integrated assessment of status that includes numerous other metrics (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016)."

Based on the recommendations in *Guidelines Working Paper*, we used benchmarks at the scale of Conservation Units to evaluate Limit Reference Points for Inside South Coast Chum. We compared two different benchmarks at the CU level: $S_{gen}$ (based on Ricker parameters) and 25^th^ percentile (based on historical abundance).  these two benchmarks for Inside South Coast Chum. We used these benchmarks for this case study because of the previous work evaluating whether abundance-based benchmarks were appropriate for data-limited Chum populations (@holt_evaluating_2018). 

### Limit Reference Points based on Logistic Models using SMU Aggregate Abundance and Status of Component CUs

We evaluated two methods for developing LRPs based on aggregate abundance for Inside South Coast Chum. The goal of these methods was to explore whether the status of component CUs could be predicted well by the aggregate abundance of the whole SMU. The motivation behind this approach is that many SMUs are not monitored at the CU level. If the aggregate abundance of the SMU could predict the status of component CUs, then an LRP that is measured in aggregate SMU abundance could be reliably used. 

These methods used 5 CUs with over 50 years of data (Bute Inlet and Upper Knight both had CU-level infilling in recent years and thus were left out of this analysis). Both approaches attempted to estimate LRPs by fitting logistic regression models to historically observed data. The two methods differ in what method was used to assess CU-level benchmarks.

The first approach uses $S_{gen}$ as a benchmark, which is derived from the parameters of the Ricker model of recruitment.

The second approach uses a percentile of past spawner abundance as a benchmark. 

These methods were applied retrospectively. For a series of years up to the most recent, the benchmarks and logistic regressions were calculated with all years up to that year. This was done for all successive years to see how the LRP (and benchmarks, and underlying stock-recruit parameters) would have changed over time as more data was collected.

Due to poor logistic model fits using the entire 19xx - 2018 time series for both Sgen and percentile benchmarks, we did not conduct retrospective analyses for this SMU. The underlying data characteristics that lead to poor logsitic model fits are highlighted in the results section below.

#### Benchmark based on stock-recruit relationships - $S_{gen}$

For Inside South Coast chum, there are no reliable data on marine survival for wild fish, and no proxies based on coded wire tag or age at return of hatchery chum in this SMU. This meant that the Ricker model used to estimate the spawner-recruit relationship did account for marine survival (compared to Interior Fraser Coho). 

The basic Ricker equation uses spawners $S$, productivity $\alpha$, and the strength of density dependence $\beta$ to predict recruits $R$ (Equation \@ref(eq:ricker)). Note that recruits includes spawners and adults caught in fishereis. We used the log-transformed Ricker equation so that the residuals/error would be normally distributed (Equation \@ref(eq:logricker)). 

\begin{equation}
    R = \alpha S e^{-\beta S} 
    (\#eq:ricker)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  log(\hat{R}) = log(\alpha_i) + log(S) - S \beta_i 
  (\#eq:logricker)
\end{equation}
  
We estimated the predicted recruits $\hat{R}$ from spawners $S$, productivity $\alpha$, and the strength of density dependence $\beta$ for each stock $i$ (Equation \@ref(eq:logricker)).  *\textcolor{cyan}{LW: is this correct about the residuals/error?}* The natural log of observed recruits per spawner $log(\frac{R}{S})$ were assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution (normal error) with mean $log(\frac{\hat{R}}{S})$ and standard deviation $\sigma_i$ (Equation \@ref(eq:likelihood-recruits)).

\begin{equation}
    log(\frac{R}{S}) \sim Normal( log(\frac{\hat{R}}{S}) , \sigma_i)
    (\#eq:likelihood-recruits)
\end{equation}

$S_MSY$ was calculated using Lambert's W function @scheurell_REF_2016 (Equation \@ref(eq:SMSY))

\begin{equation}
    S_{MSY} = \frac { 1 - Lambert_W(e ^ {1-log(\alpha)})} {\beta}
    (\#eq:SMSY)
\end{equation}

$S_{gen}$ was estimated from $S_{MSY}$ by assuming that the difference between the $\hat{S}_{MSY}$ (estimated from $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $S_{gen}$) and the $S_{MSY}$ calculated using Lambert's W function was normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_{S_{gen}}$ (Equations \@ref(eq:Sgen), \@ref(eq:likelihood-Sgen)).

\begin{equation}
    log(\hat{S}_{MSY}) = log(\alpha) + log(S_{gen}) - \beta S_{gen}
    (\#eq:Sgen)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{S}_{MSY} - S_{MSY} \sim Normal( 0, \sigma_{S_{gen}})
    (\#eq:likelihood-Sgen)
\end{equation}


We used R (ref) and the Template Model Builder *TMB* package to fit Ricker models and logistic regressions of aggregate abundance (@kristensen_tmb_2016). 

Caveats with benchmarks based on $S_{gen}$ or stock-recruit parameters:

- Ignores variability in actual recruits/spawner ($S_{gen}$ is based on mean $\alpha$ value). This can be problematic if there are large residuals (especially negative) in the stock-recruit curve at low spawner abundance. For example, if 20% of the time (based on record of recruits/spawner), $S_{gen}$ spawners actually had recruits/spawner less than 1. Then you set up a potential tail-spin to low abundance, depending on the frequency of these low recruitment cohorts at low abundance.
- Because they are set at the CU level (high level in terms of stock-recruit relationship, not at the scale of stream-level density-dependence or ocean-level density dependence including overlapping species (e.g., Alaska, pacific ocean)), they may not explicitly model density dependence at scales where it is probably occurring.
- Assumes productivity and density-dependence are constant
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are negatively correlated: sensitive to each other, especially when fit is not good, this is problematic, especially since $S_{MSY}$ and $S_{gen}$ depend on both $\alpha$ and $\beta$
- $MSY$ and its derivatives, e.g., $S_{MSY}$, $S_{gen}$ are not based on COSEWIC risk of extinction metrics such as percent decreases in spawner abundance
- Doesn't account for depensation
- The only dependent variables used are recruits and spawners, no other variables that are possibly linked to productivity

#### Benchmark based on historical abundance - Percentile

*\textcolor{cyan}{LW: some of this is probably too much detail, but I am keeping track of my thoughts here for now}*

Estimating benchmarks for salmon populations without a long time series and without data on prodcutivity (only escapement, no recruits/smolt production) is challenging. Previous evaluations of Inside South Coast chum population status used a 25% benchmark (@hilborn_british_2012). This was based on previous work by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game that defined four tiers of populations based on conrast in spawner abunances, harvest rate, and precision of escapement data (@bue_escapement_2001, @otis_escapement_2004). The goal of these tiers was to choose a Sustainable Escapement Goal (an upper and lower percentile) to use as a goal for escapement to "represents a proxy for maintaining escapements within a range that encompasses $S_{MSY}$" (@clark_evaluation_2014). These SEGs were calculated for each major river/system and are still done that way now in Alaska (@mckinley_review_2020). Tier 1 of this method was for high escapement contrast (greater than 8) and at least moderate harvest rate, with a SEG of 25th to 75th percentiles. @bue_escapement_2001 assessed this method on "11 selected stocks. The specific stocks examined were 2 sockeye salmon and 2 Chinook salmon stocks from Upper Cook Inlet, and 7 sockeye salmon stocks from Bristol Bay (in @clark_evaluation_2014). @clark_evaluation_2014 tested the suitability of this 4 tier percentile approach by applying a theoretical, simulation, and meta-analysis on "76 stock-recruitment data sets from throughout Alaska using a standard linear regression approach. These data included historical stock-recruitment observations for 7 pink salmon, 7 coho salmon, 43 sockeye salmon, 6 chum salmon stocks, and 13 Chinook salmon stocks". They recommended a revised 3 tier system, which changed the Tier 1 lower perecntile to 20%. @hilborn_british_2012 adopted the previous 25% lower limit of SEG as a benchmark for evaluating the status of Inside South Coast Chum in BC for the purpose of certification with the Marine Stewardship Council (@hilborn_british_2012), despite it lack of testing for populations of chum salmon in British Columbia. Further, SEGs were and still are applied to individual rivers in Alaska, compared to the application of this method to entire CUs, which, for ISC Chum, which has 296 streams among the seven CUs, with 126 in Strait of Georgia alone. By aggregating spawners and recruits across many rivers before estimating benchmarks of percentile or stock-recruit parameters, the following problems may arise:

- Error in fitting stock-recruit curves because it is at aggregate level instead of by river
- Sum of $S_{gen}$ calculated for individual rivers may not equal $S_{gen}$ calculated using aggregated spawner and recruit data
- Non-stationarity of productivity in individual systems may be hidden by aggregating spawners and recruits
- Spawner abundance at CU level may not be a good predictor of status of individual rivers compared to SEGs at the river scale (similar to the problem of SMU aggregate LRP logistic regression), depending on the contrast in size between rivers and the correlation (or lack) in escapement and/or productivity

The suitability of the percentile method was evaluated for chum populations in BC by @holt_evaluating_2018, who tested how well percentile benchmarks matched benchmarks from stock-recruit parameters for Inside South Coast Chum, using retrospective and simulation analyses. Among other things, they tested how well a 25% percentile benchmark (and higher values up to 50%) compared to estimates of $S_{gen}$ for these CUs. They found that:

- Percentile benchmarks (even 50%) under moderate-high harvest rates and low-moderate productivity tended to underestimate 'true' $S_{gen}$ values, which would lead to optimistic and incorrect status assessments. More work on alternatives to percentile benchmarks are needed in this case
- Time series bias tends to under-estimate $S_{gen}$ 
 
From @holt_evaluating_2018 Table 6, productivity values, recommendations:

- Productivity (Ricker $\alpha$) between 2.5-4, harvest rate 20-40%: 25^th^ lower benchmark (Georgia Strait, Howe Sound Burrard Inlet)
- Productivity ($\alpha$) between 1.5-2.5 and: 
  - harvest rate 0-20%: 50^th^ lower benchmark (Loughborough, Northeast Vancouver Island, Upper Knight)
  - harvest rate 20-40%: further evaluation required, percentiles not recommended (Bute Inlet)
- Productivity ($\alpha$) <1.5: no category in @holt_evaluating_2018, assume further evaluation required, percentiles not recommended (Southern Coastal Streams)

We used 25% of spawner abundance as a benchmark for Georgia Strait and Howe Sound Burrard Inlet, 50% for Loughborough, Northeast Vancouver Island, Upper Knight, and the multidimensional approach for Bute Inlet and Southern Coastal Streams.*\textcolor{cyan}{LW: may need to revise the last three based on multi-dimensional methods}*

Caveats with benchmarks based on percentile of abundance: 

- Shifting baselines within period of data (e.g., Southern Coastal Streams)
- Shifting baselines (higher baseline before period of data)
- Assumes productivity (recruits/spawner) stationary
- record only starts with data 
- Accounting for fishing mortality? percentile of recruits vs. escapement

#### Other considerations for benchmarks from COSEWIC framework

- % decreases in abundance
- Time frame (10 years / 3 generations)
- Consideration of causes and a higher level of caution: "where reduction or its causes may not have ceased or may not be understood of may not be reversible"

### Regression forms

Regression forms are described in [Chapter 2][LOGISTIC REGRESSION LRPS]

We tested Bernoulli and Binomial regression forms. Because LRPs based on Binomial regressions are highly sensitive to which proportion of CUs above their benhcmark is chosed (e.g., 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99), we chose to proceed with the Bernoulli regression, which does not have this issue.

### PROJECTED LRPS (TBD)

### MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH

The State of the Salmon program (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) is developing a method of assessing the status of CUs. This method uses a decision tree to evaluate status based on data type, quality, abundance, and trends *\textcolor{cyan}{probably more here when we get the background methods}*. This work is based on Wild Salmon Policy status assessments for Fraser River sockeye (**REF**), Interior Fraser coho (**REF**), and Southern BC Chinook (**REF**).

## RESULTS

### LRPs based on SMU aggregate abundance and logistic models


The logistic models predicting whether all CUs were above their benchmark based on aggregate abundance fit the data poorly (Figures \@ref(fig:chum-logistic-sgen), \@ref(fig:chum-logistic-perc)). In both cases, the sum of abundance for all CUs in a given year was not a good predictor of whether those CUs were above their benchmarks in that year. Note that these regressions used the aggregate abundance of only the CUs used in the regressions, and excluded the other CUs. 

Highlight low covariance and differences in scale, and describe how these make empirical LRPs unsuitable for this SMU

Why? The Inside South Coast Chum SMu is made up of seven CUs that vary in their escapement abundance. George Strait and Howe Sound-Burrard Inlet have escapement in many years that are greater than the other CUs by two orders of magnitude. In addition, the correlation in escapement among these seven CUs is low. These characteristics mean that the aggregate abundance may be high due to one or more CUs with high escapements being high, while one more smaller escapements is below its benchmark. High aggregate escapements do not mean that all CUs are above their benchmark. This makes sense because:

- Large geographical range of SMU / component CUs
- Lots of different populations
- Differences in productivity among CUs/populations
