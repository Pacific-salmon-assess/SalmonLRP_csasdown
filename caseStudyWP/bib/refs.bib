	abstract = {Thirty-nine years of scale growth measurements from Big Qualicum River chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in southern British Columbia demonstrated that competition and climate variation affect marine growth and age-at-maturity. A longitudinal study design that accounted for correlation among individuals revealed growth at all ages was reduced when the biomass of North American chum, sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) was high. When North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation ({NPGO}) was positive, indicating increased primary productivity, predicted growth increased. Climate variation inﬂuenced competition effects. For instance, density-dependent competition effects increased when {NPGO} became more positive and Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation became more negative (indicating cool conditions), causing the greatest range in predicted scale size. Chum salmon are likely to exhibit continued reduction in growth at age due to increased ocean temperatures driven by climate change and high aggregate salmon biomass that includes hatchery releases. If evidence of biomass and climate effects presented here are common among Paciﬁc salmon populations, reduction of hatchery releases should be considered.},
