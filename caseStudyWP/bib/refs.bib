  abstract = {A portfolio of habitats To conserve species, we must conserve their habitat. This concept is well known, but the reality is much more complex than simply conserving a particular area. Habitats are dynamic and vary across both space and time. Such variation can help to facilitate long-term persistence of species by allowing local movement in search of the best conditions. Brennan et al. clearly demonstrate the benefit of the habitat mosaic to Pacific salmon by characterizing how both climate and population productivity vary over time and space in an Alaskan river system. Science, this issue p. 783 Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin. Mosaics of habitat increase resilience in salmon populations. Mosaics of habitat increase resilience in salmon populations.},

  abstract = {Despite growing recognition that complex population portfolios are important sources of ecosystem stability and resilience, the structure of such stock complexes is often not considered in monitoring schemes to inform environmental impact assessments. The use of ``index'' or ``indicator'' sites, and of short assessment windows, to make broad claims about the relative importance of specific habitats or populations within a portfolio, assume that regional populations are highly synchronous and that abundance is stable through time. Asynchrony among populations and changes in population productivity over time render these assumptions fundamentally flawed. We used 57 years of abundance data for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) spawning in a set of eight streams in the Wood River watershed, southwest Alaska, to demonstrate how natural patterns of variability affect the ability of fixed assessment windows to characterize the contribution of individual populations to the entire portfolio. Additionally, simulations were used to demonstrate how different levels of synchrony and autocor\- relation affect the ability of monitoring schemes to estimate the contributions of individual populations to a portfolio over the long-term. We found that fixed assessment windows were distinctly limited in their ability to characterize a population's contribution to a portfolio over the long-tem. Asynchronous dynamics among pop\- ulations, and the presence of autocorrelation that creates slow changes in populations, weaken the ability to characterize a stream's potential contribution to a portfolio from short-term assessments. These results suggest that the structure of population portfolios, and the presence of directional changes in productivity within in\- dividual populations, need to be taken into account when carrying out environmental risk assessments that aim to measure the contribution of an individual population or habitat to system wide dynamics. Typical risk as\- sessments that depend on short monitoring periods are likely to vastly underestimate the potential long-term value of any specific habitat, and the population it supports, as a component of a multi-population portfolio.},

A longitudinal study design that accounted for correlation among individuals revealed growth at all ages was reduced when the biomass of North American chum, sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) was high. When North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) was positive, indicating increased primary productivity, predicted growth increased. Climate variation influenced competition effects. For instance, density-dependent competition effects increased when NPGO became more positive and Pacific Decadal Oscillation became more negative (indicating cool conditions), causing the greatest range in predicted scale size. Chum salmon are likely to exhibit continued reduction in growth at age due to increased ocean temperatures driven by climate change and high aggregate salmon biomass that includes hatchery releases. If evidence of biomass and climate effects presented here are common among Pacific salmon populations, reduction of hatchery releases should be considered.},

However, detecting such trends is difficult because observation error and natural variability in survival rates tend to obscure underlying trends. A Kalman filter estimation procedure has previously been shown to be effective in such situations. We used it on a Ricker spawner\textendash recruit model to reconstruct indices of annual productivity (recruits per spawner (R/S) at low spawner abundance) based on historical data for 120 stocks of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. These stocks were from Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. The resulting estimated temporal trends in productivity show large changes (on average 60\%\textendash 70\% differences in R/S and average ratios of highest to lowest R/S between 5.4 and 7.9 for the three species). Such changes suggest that salmon stock assessment methods should take into account possible nonstationarity. This step will help provide scientific advice to help managers to meet conservation and management objectives. The Kalman filter results also identified some stocks that did not share temporal trends with other stocks; these exceptions may require special monitoring and management efforts.},

In exploited systems, however, management goals to preserve diversity may be in tension with harvest objectives. For example, fisheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of fisheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a Pacific salmon stock aggregate and its fishery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries influences management performance. We focused on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon fisheries. Additionally, we examined how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock fisheries may change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We found that increasing single-stock fishery allocations increased aggregate abundance and improved the status of some stocks relative to their conservation benchmarks. However, these improvements did not occur uniformly\textendash relatively abundant, productive stocks exhibited no change, or even declines, in conservation performance as single-stock fishery allocations increased. Furthermore, differences in performance between mixed- and single-stock fisheries were reduced when productivity was uniformly low, when the mixedstock fishery was managed conservatively, or when mortality during freshwater migrations was high. While single-stock fisheries can increase the probability that conservation-based objectives will be met, they are not a panacea and may only be effective when specific conditions are met.},

Alternative benchmarks have been proposed for data-limited Conservation Units (CUs) using percentiles of the observed spawner abundance time-series. However, these benchmarks have not been evaluated against stock-recruitment benchmarks currently used to assess status on abundances for data-rich CUs. Our goals were to evaluate percentile-based benchmarks against stock-recruitment based benchmarks accounting for high uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates, and age-at-maturity. We used two approaches to evaluate benchmarks based on a retrospective comparison through the historical record and a prospective simulation model under numerous hypothetical future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach for providing assessments that accounts for uncertainties in benchmarks, and provide advice on the applicability of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon relative to stock-recruitment benchmarks used for data-rich CUs. In general, our results support the application of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high ({$>$}2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate ({$\leq$}40\%). However, we suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks (and the consideration of alternatives) when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. Under these conditions, concurrent declines in abundances and percentile benchmarks can results in status assessments that are more optimistic than those from stock-recruitment benchmarks due to shifting baselines.},

  abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({$\approx$} 106) and parameters ({$\approx$} 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

  abstract = {Over the last 5 decades, natural populations of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon were the most abundant salmon species returning to Washington, USA. Pink salmon predominantly returned in odd years, and chum salmon stocks that interacted with pink salmon exhibited strong even- and odd-year variations in abundance, size, age-at-maturity, and productivity (recruits-per-spawner). We investigated the effects of competition between pink and chum salmon originating from Washington during different life-history phases. Overall, chum salmon returns were 34\% lower in pink salmon (odd) years compared to non-pink salmon (even) years. Chum salmon productivity tended to be below average for odd broods, especially along the Washington coast where there are no pink salmon populations, suggesting that competition during overlapping marine periods established their distinct even- and odd-year patterns. We evaluated long-term trends in chum (and pink) salmon productivity using correlation and time series analysis and examined the influence of ocean indicators on those trends. In general, chum salmon productivity increased between brood years 1968 and 1989 and was positively related to summertime Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), but declined between brood years 1990 and 2012 and was negatively related to the PDO. Pink salmon productivity had no directional trend, but exhibited declines over the last decade and was negatively related to the PDO over the entire time series. Chum salmon productivity was also negatively related to pink salmon abundance, supporting the conclusion that ocean conditions and competition accounted for brood-year differences in chum salmon age-at-maturity and lower returns in odd versus even years.},

  abstract = {Increasing the abundance of salmon in Oregon's rivers and streams is a high-priority, public policy objective. Salmon runs have been reduced from predevelopment conditions (typically defined as prior to 1850), but it is unclear by how much. Considerable public and private resources have been devoted to restoring salmon runs, but it is uncertain what the current recovery potential is because much of the freshwater and estuarine habitat for salmon has been altered and there is no expectation that it will be returned to a predevelopment condition. The goals of all salmon recovery efforts are based on assumptions about the size of the runs prior to significant habitat alteration, coupled with an estimate of the amount and quality of freshwater and estuarine habitat currently available. We estimated the historical aggregate salmon run size in rivers along the Oregon coast (excluding the Columbia River) using two methods: (1) converting estimated aboriginal population levels into numbers of salmon; (2) extrapolating cannery pack into numbers of salmon. Annual aboriginal harvest of all salmon species is estimated to have been approximately 10 million pounds per year (4,500,000 kg) or 1.75\textendash 5.36 million salmon, a harvest level similar to that occurring during the height of commercial fishing on Oregon's coastal rivers in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Extrapolating cannery pack data, the estimated size of the late 1800s aggregate runs of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) was 1.5\textendash 2.5 million. The estimated size of aggregate runs of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) runs was 290,000\textendash 517,000. Compared to our estimates of mid-1800s coho salmon levels, early 2000 runs (during favorable ocean conditions), were 11\textendash 19\% of the historical level. During poor ocean conditions (1990s), current coho salmon runs were 3\textendash 6\% of the historical size.},

Thus, the biodiversity that provides benefits may also make sustainable resource extraction more difficult, a key challenge in fisheries management. We simulated a mixed-\-stock fishery to explore relationships between different dimensions of biodiversity and fishery performance relative to conservation and fishery objectives. Different dimensions of biodiversity (number of stocks, evenness, asynchrony among stocks, heterogeneity in stock productivity) exacerbated trade-\-offs between fishery and conservation objectives. For example, fisheries targeting stock-\-complexes with greater asynchrony, and to a lesser extent richness, had greater stability in harvest through time but also greater risks of overfishing weak stocks and reduced yield compared to less biodiverse stock-\-complexes. These trade-\-offs were ameliorated by increasing management control\textemdash\-the capacity of fishery managers to harvest specific stocks. To explore these trade-\-offs in real-\-world fisheries, we contrasted the fishing and population status of individual stocks within three major mixed-\-stock sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, Salmonidae) fisheries\textemdash\-Bristol Bay, Fraser River, and Skeena River. In general, the fisheries with lower management control had individual stocks that were more often being over-\-or under-\-fished, compared with those with higher management control, though variation among regions in biodiversity, scale of management, and magnitude of habitat alteration likely also contribute to these relationships. Collectively, our findings emphasize that there is a need to extract less or regulate better in order to conserve and benefit from biodiversity in fisheries and other natural resource management systems.},

Unfortunately, time series data are often limited to counts of adult abundance and harvest. By incorporating data from other populations and by dynamically linking the life-history stages, Bayesian life-cycle models can be used to estimate stagespecific productivities and capacities as well as abundance of breeders that produce maximum sustained yield (MSY). Using coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) as our case study, we show that incorporating information on marine survival variability from nearby populations can improve model estimates and affect management parameters such as escapement at MSY. We further show that the expected long-term average yield of a fishery managed for a spawner escapement target that produces MSY strongly depends on the average marine survival. Our results illustrate the usefulness of incorporating information from other sources and highlight the importance of accounting for variation in marine survival when making inferences about the management of Pacific salmon.},

The model is based on a collective analysis of the dynamics of 13 stock units (SUs) from two continental stock groups (CSGs) in North America and Southern Europe in a single hierarchical model over the period 1971\textendash 2014. The model sets up a new assessment framework for Atlantic salmon stocks. It also provides a framework to investigate the drivers of changes in Atlantic salmon population dynamics including disentangling the effects of fisheries from those of environmental factors in a hierarchy of spatial scales. It is used to test the hypothesis of a strong spatial synchrony in marine life history dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations. The trends in two key parameters associated with the early marine phase of the life cycle are estimated: (i) the marine survival during the first summer\textendash autumn spent at sea and (ii) the proportion of fish maturing after the first winter at sea. The results provide evidence of a decline in the marine survival together with an increase in the proportion of fish that mature after the first winter at sea, common to all SUs. Our results show an increased coherence in the covariations of trends in these two marine life history traits related to geographic proximity of SUs which support the hypothesis of a coherent response of geographically proximate Atlantic salmon populations that likely share similar migration routes.},

  abstract = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada requires escapement goals for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks to evaluate their status and achieve objectives established by international agreements and domestic policy. Unfortunately the data typically needed to establish these `goals', using stock-recruitment techniques, are expensive to gather and are, for most stocks, lacking. This prompted us to develop the habitat-based approach to generate escapement goals described in this report. We related productive capacity to freshwater habitat area based on results from a meta-analysis of 25 Chinook stocks. Stocks were distributed between central Alaska and northern Oregon and represented a broad range of environments and life history. We developed an allometric model that predicted Smsy and Srep (spawners required to produced maximum sustained yield and replacement, respectively) from the watershed area and assessed the model's performance. The model adequately predicted the Smsy and Srep for an independent data source and out-performed a current interim method applied to British Columbia (BC) Key Streams. The habitat-based approach adequately predicted Smsy and Srep for seven case study examples, although it overestimated the productive capacity of stocks with relatively small spawning areas. Our habitat-based model can generate biologically-based escapement goals, rooted in fish-production relationships, for data limited stocks over a broad range of environments. This simple approach requires easily acquirable data and makes few assumptions. However, spawner escapements of known accuracy and reliability are required, which may impede implementation for some systems. The approach is well-suited for most data limited stocks in BC and can be tested and refined as new stock-recruitment data become available. Since the habitat-based method was more accurate than the interim method for BC Key Streams, we recommend applying it for data limited stocks in BC to establish escapement goals until more stock-specific data are available.}

  abstract = {We used reported commercial catch data and historical information to estimate the abundance of Skeena River Chum Salmon Oncorhynchus keta during the early rise (1916\textendash 1919) in the commercial fishery to provide historical perspective for recovery plans. We applied a Bayesian analysis to address the uncertainties associated with the estimation process. Based on the historical catch of 204,000 in 1919 and an estimated harvest rate of 0.32\textendash 0.58, the estimated return of Skeena Chum Salmon ranged from 355,000 to 619,000, with the most probable single estimate being 431,000. The estimated return of Chum Salmon based on the 1916\textendash 1919 geometric mean catch of 154,000 ranged from 268,000 to 471,000, with the most probable single estimate being 325,000. Our posterior modal historical estimates are 8\textendash 11 times larger than the estimates for the contemporary period 1982\textendash 2010 and 39\textendash 52 times larger than those for the most recent period of 2007\textendash 2010. Intense harvest pressure is the single most probable factor explaining the sustained decline in Chum Salmon abundance, but other interactive factors, notably natural variations in survival, the loss of spawning and rearing habitat, and poor data quality, also are important considerations. Nonetheless, the Skeena catchment is largely pristine today, and our robust estimates of historical abundance should be of value to contemporary management and conservation agencies for the rebuilding of such severely diminished populations.},

We applied genetic tools to a unique collection of 100-year-old salmon scales to reveal declines of 56\%\textendash 99\% in wild sockeye populations across Canada's second largest salmon watershed, the Skeena River. These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to ``bridge'' Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi'kmaw) embraces ``learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,'' as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative\textemdash central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

In particular, Ricker's stock recruitment model is widely used due to its flexibility and ease with which the parameters can be estimated. After model fitting, the spawning stock size that produces the maximum sustainable yield (               S               MSY               ) to a fishery, and the harvest corresponding to it (               U               MSY               ), are two of the most common biological reference points of interest to fisheries managers. However, to date there has been no explicit solution for either reference point because of the transcendental nature of the equation needed to solve for them. Therefore, numerical or statistical approximations have been used for more than 30 years. Here I provide explicit formulae for calculating both               S               MSY               and               U               MSY               in terms of the productivity and density-dependent parameters of Ricker's model.},
