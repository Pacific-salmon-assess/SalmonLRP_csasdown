# LRP ESTIMATION METHODS

In this section, we provide an overview of methods used to develop LRPs for our three case studies. Detailed methods specific to each case study are provided in Sections 3 (Interior Fraser Coho), 4 (WCVI Chinook), and 5 (Inner South Coast Chum, excluding Fraser). 

## OVERVIEW

We consider two types of LRPs based on two different metrics:

1) Proportion-based LRPs, which are based on the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above 'poor' status. We assume that in order for an SMU to remain above its proportion-based LRP, 100% of CUs must have status estimates above poor. 

2) Aggregate abundance-based LRPs, which are based on total SMU-level spawning abundance. 

While aggregate abundance-based LRPs are consistent with what is typically used for marine fish species, proportion-based LRPs have been proposed for Pacific salmon to align with DFO's Wild Salmon Policy. 

When developing aggregate abundance-based LRP options for salmon SMUs, we aim to maintain consistency with the WSP by defining LRPs as aggregate abundance levels that have a high probability of all CUs being above poor status. We use two different methods to identify these levels: (i) Logistic regression-based LRPs and (ii) Projection-based LRPs. More detailed descriptions of these methods are provided in the following sections, while guidance on when and how proportion-based and aggregate abundance-based LRPs should be applied is provided in Holt et al. (in review). We do not recommend that users apply any of the methods described in this case study paper without first consulting Holt et al. (in review).

The above definitions hinge on what defines 'poor' CU status. In the case of WSP Integrated Status Assessments, in which multiple metrics are combined to assign CU status, poor status corresponds with the 'red' status zone (@canadaCanadaPolicyConservation2005, @grant2017FraserSockeye2020). While WSP Integrated status assessments are typically intensive expert-driven processes, we demonstrate the application of a multidimensional scanning tool that is being developed by DFO's State of the Salmon Program to rapidly assess CU status under the WSP. When developing aggregate abundance-based LRPs, we also consider cases in which CU status is based on a single lower benchmark that has been identified as important for individual CUs by local experts. A variety of methods are available for estimating lower benchmarks depending on species and data availability (@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009, @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018, @grant2017FraserSockeye2020]. 
 

## PROPORTION-BASED LRPS

A proportion-based LRP is simply the proportion of CUs required to be assessed as being above poor status. In all three case studies, we default to 100% of CUs being required to be above poor status when setting the LRP. In this case, the LRP acts as a trigger that is breached when one of more CUs is assessed as having poor status. Guidance on how to select the required proportion, including when it may be appropriate to consider proportions < 100%, is provided in the companion working paper *Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units* (Holt et al. in review). 

We compare three different methods of assessing CU status when using proportion-based LRPs: (i) the proportion of CUs with a recent Integrated Status assessment above the red zone (e.g., @grant2017FraserSockeye2020), (ii) the proportion of CUs with a recent rapid multidimensional status assessment above red (see below for more details), and (iii) the proportion of CUs with status estimated to be below a single type of CU lower benchmark (e.g., $S_{gen}$, percentile-babsed benchmarks, etc.). 


### Rapid Multidimensional Status Assessment Tool{#rapidToolMethods}

<!-- Note from Sue:

For multi-dimensional status, we are using the term ‘lower benchmark’ to be Red status zone for the CU. Not entirely a correct usage of this term, but applies it to the language used for LRP triggers of rebuilding plans.

-->

One of the methods we consider to estimate CU status for proportion-based LRP relies on a method of rapidly assessing CU status using multidimensional algorithms.  We implement this approach using a scanner tool that has recently been developed by DFO's State of the Salmon Program (@pestalAlgorithmsRapidStatus2021, in prep). The scanning tool is intended to support implementation of Canada's WSP by approximating the outcomes of full Integrated Status Assessments on an more regular basis than time-intensive Integrated Status Assessment methods allows. The rapid multidimensional scanning tool was developed using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses to create algorithms that approximate the status of the integrated assessments.  Data inputs and outcomes from thee Integrated Assessment processes were used in CART analyses: Fraser River sockeye, Interior Fraser coho, and Southern BC Chinook (@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015, @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016, @dfo2017FraserSockeye2018,  @grant2017FraserSockeye2020). Essentially, the scanning tool uses a decision tree to estimate CU status based on data type, quality, abundance, and trends t(e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree)). An expert review of rapid status results for each CU is intended to be incorporated into application of this tool (S. Grant, pers comm). When using this method in the case study, we took the outputs of the algorithms at face value and did not confirm using expert opinion.

## AGGREGATE ABUNDANCE-BASED LRPS

Aggregate abundance-based LRPs represent the SMU-level abundance at which there is a sufficiently high probability that 100% of CUs will be above a single selected benchmark. This definition requires a decision to be made about what represents a 'sufficiently high probability' that 100% of CUs will be above their benchmarks. We consider four alternative probability levels for our case studies that represent a range of calibrated probability categories developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [@frameGuidanceNoteLead2010]: 50%, 66%, 90%, and 99%. The 50% value represents the mid-point of the "About as likely as not" category (33 - 66%), indicating that there is an equal probability that all CUs will be above their LBMs as there is that they will not. The 66% values represents the lower end of the "Likely" category (i.e., it is "Likely" that all CUs will be above their LBMs), the 90% value represents the lower end of the "Very Likely" category, and the 99% value represents the "Virtually Certain" category. A discussion of considerations for selecting the appropriate probability threshold when calculating abundance-based LRPs is included in the working paper *Guidelines for Defining Limit Reference Points for Pacific Salmon Stock Management Units* (Holt et al. in review).  For our case studies, we focus on a 50% probability threshold for sensitivity analyses, but show sensitivity to other values.  
 
We consider two types of aggregate abundance-based LRPs in our case studies: Logistic regression-based LRPs and Projection-based LRPs.  Logistic regression LRPs are estimated using historical data, and thus represent conditions that have been previously experienced by a SMU. In comparison, projection-based LRPs use historical data as a basis for quantifying population dynamics, but are based on projections of future states, and thus, allow uncertainty in future processes to be accounted for through alternative scenarios.  

### Logistic regression-based LRPs{#logisticMethods}

Logistic regression-based LRPs (also called Logistic regression LRPs) are derived from an empirically estimated relationship between CU-level status and aggregate SMU abundance. Using this approach, the LRP represents the aggregate abundance level that has historically been associated with a given probability of 100% of CUs being above their lower benchmarks. For each year of observed data, CU-level status is quantified as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have estimated status greater than their lower benchmark (LBM) and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have status > LBM. A logistic regression is then fit to predict the probability that all CUs will have status > LBM as a function of aggregate spawner abundance to the SMU using the logistic regression equation:

\begin{equation}
  \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = B_0 + B_1 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t}
   (\#eq:logistic)
\end{equation}

where, $p$ is probability, $B_0$ and $B_1$ are estimated logistic regression parameters and $S_{i,t}$ is spawner abundance to CU $i$ in year $t$. Equation \@ref(eq:logistic) is then re-arranged to calculate the LRP as the aggregate spawner abundance associated with the pre-specified probability threshold of $p^*$,

\begin{equation}
  LRP = \frac{log(\frac{p^*}{1-p^*}) - B_0}{B_1}
  (\#eq:logisticLRP)
\end{equation}

An example logistic regression fit is shown in Figure\@ref(fig:example-logisticFit). We show the estimation of LRPs based on this fit for four possible probability thresholds: $p^*$ = 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, and 0.99. For each $p^*$ level, LRP estimates represent the aggregate abundance that is associated with that probability of all CUs having status greater than their LBM. Logistic regression models were fit using TMB (citation), with resulting LRP estimates from equation \@ref(eq:logisticLRP) calculated within the code. Uncertainty in LRP estimates were quantified based on a 95% confidence interval on the MLE estimate.

```

We initially considered an alternative approach to logistic regression in which the LRP represents the aggregate abundance that has historically been associated with a pre-specified proportion of CUs being above their lower benchmark. Using this approach, CU-level status was quantified as the number or CUs with status > LBM for each year of observed data.  A logistic regression was then fit to predict the proportion of CUs with status > LBM as a function of aggregate spawner abundance to the SMU (i.e., abundance from nCUs combined). We do not show present this method for our case studies however due to inherent limitations when the required proportion of CUs above their lower benchmarks is 100%. Equation \@ref(eq:logisticLRP) cannot be solved directly for a threshold proportion of $p^*$ = 100%, and LRP estimates were highly sensitive to the choice of $p^*$ value used as a proxy. Using $p^*$ = 99% vs. $p^*$ = 99.9% vs. $p^*$ = 99.99% gave very different LRP estimates. 


##### Logistic Regression Model Diagnostics  

There are several assumptions associated with logistic regression, of which four that are relevant for our application to LRPs are listed below. Model diagnostics were applied to evaluate the extent to which those assumptions were met, as well as statistical significance of model coefficients, goodness-of-fit, and classification accuracy of LRPs developed from the logistic regression. All analyses were implemented using R v.4.0.4 unless otherwise specified [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2021].  The four assumptions are as follows:

1. The relationship between aggregate abundance and log-odds (the logarithm of the odds of all CUs being above their lower benchmark) is linear.

2. The observations are independent of each other (i.e., residuals are not autocorrelated).

3. There are no influential outliers. 

4. The sample size is large. Logistic regression assumes that the sample size of the data set is large enough to draw valid conclusions from the fitted model.


**Evaluating assumption of linearity (Assumption 1)**

A Box-Tidwell test was used to evaluate linearity by assessing the significance of an additional interaction term in the logistic regression, 

\begin{equation}
  \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = B_0 + B_1 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t} + B_2 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t} \times \log (\sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t})
   (\#eq:BoxTidwelllogistic)
\end{equation}

A significant interaction term $B_2$, indicates a non-linear relationship between aggregate abundance and log-odds, violating this assumption [@foxAppliedRegressionAnalysis2016].


**Evaluating independence (Assumption 2)**

Deviance residuals, $d$, were estimated for each year,

\begin{equation}
   d = \pm \sqrt { -2 ( y \log(\frac{\mu}{y}) + (1-y)\log(\frac{1-\mu}{1-y}) ) }
   (\#eq:DevianceResid)
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the predicted probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark and $y$ is the observation (1 or 0, indicating all CUs above or not, respectively), in a given year [@fox_applied_2016]. Equation \@ref(eq:DevianceResid) reduces to,

\begin{equation}
   d =  - \sqrt { -2 \log(1-\mu) }
   (\#eq:DevianceResidy0)
\end{equation}

when $y=0$, and to,

\begin{equation}
   d =  \sqrt { -2 \log(\mu)  }
   (\#eq:DevianceResidy1)
\end{equation}

when $y=1$ [@ahmad_diagnostic_2011].


The magnitude of lag-1 autocorrelation was then estimated among deviance residuals and evaluated for statistical significance. 


**Evaluating outliers (Assumption 3)**

We were not able to identify influential outliers for our case studies because TMB, the software used to estimate model parameters, does not provide the hat-matrix required to assess influence of individual points.  Instead, we focused on identifying outliers based on the general rule of thumb that deviance residuals greater than 2 are considered to be to be outliers because 95\% of the distribution is expected to be within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Further work to identify influential outliers is recommended when other statistical model fitting tools are used. 


**Evaluating sample size (Assumption 4)**

A minimum of 10 data points for the least frequent outcome is recommended to avoid biases in model coefficients [@peduzziSimulationStudyNumber1996]. For example, if the frequency of outcomes were 0.5 and 0.5 (for 0 and 1, respectively), then a sample size of at least 10/0.5 = 20 would be sufficient, and this minimum sample size would be higher if the data were skewed, e.g., if frequency of outcomes were 0.7 and 0.3, the minimum sample size would be 10/0.3 = 33. Although it is possible to estimate LRPs with lower sample sizes, the risks of biases in model parameters increases.


**Statistical significance of model coefficients**

Statistical significance of coefficients was evaluated using the Wald test statistic, calculated from the ratio of the model coefficient to the standard error of that coefficient, which is assumed to be normally distributed. Test statistics and significance were estimated within TMB [@kristensen_tmb_2016]. <!-- Not needed: P-values <0.05 indicate that the null hypothesis of the coefficient being equalt to 0 is rejected [@fox_applied_2016].-->


**Goodness-of-fit**

The goodness-of-fit was evaluated by comparing the ratio of residual deviance to null deviance (similar to a likelihood ratio). This ratio is assumed to follow a Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom, where 1 degree of freedom is based on the difference in the number of parameters between full and null models. P-values <0.05 indicate significant lack of fit [@foxAppliedRegressionAnalysis2016].

In addition, the quasi-$R^2$ was calculated to indicate the ratio of the model fit to the null model without an independent variable, 

\begin{equation}
   quasi-R^2 =  1- \frac{\sum_{t}^{t=nYears} d} {\sum_{t}^{t=nYears} d_0} 
   (\#eq:quasiR2)
\end{equation}

where $d_0$ are the deviance residuals for the null model. The quasi-$R^2$ is a measure of the strength of the relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, but unlike $R^2$ values for linear models, it does not represent the percentage of variance explained by the model and is not related to the correlation coefficient.

<!-- K.Holt: Is there a reference for quasi-r2? The one is the code is https://bookdown.org/egarpor/SSS2-UC3M/logreg-deviance.html, but I don't think this is citable-->

**Classification accuracy of LRPs**

Classification accuracy was evaluated based on the ratio of successful classifications to total number of data points in the logistic regression, also called the hit ratio. Successful classifications were the number of years when the model successfully predicted that all CUs were above their lower benchmark plus the number years when the model successfully predicted that at least one CU was below its lower benchmark.  The hit ratio tends to be biased towards unrealistically good classification rates when computed with the same sample used for fitting the logistic model. Therefore, we also considered an out-of-sample approach to classification accuracy, where the logistic regression was estimated iteratively removing a single data point and the occurrence of successes relative to observations were based on the model that did not contain that data point. 



### PROJECTION-BASED LRPS{#projectedMethods}

The projection-based LRP approach combines all the information known for individual CUs within an SMU and then uses that information to project abundance trends into the future. Projection-based LRPs are then estimated using projected future CU abundances to characterize the relationship between aggregate SMU-level spawner abundance and the probability that all CUs will be above their lower benchmarks (e.g. $S_{gen}$) at a given level of exploitation. This approach allows for explicit consideration of uncertainty as the user can specify various projection scenarios to reflect lack of biological or fisheries information.     

We used the samSim modelling tool to conduct stochastic projections for our case study applications. samSim is an R package that was developed to quantify recovery potential for Pacific salmon populations (@holtQuantitativeToolEvaluating2020b, @freshwaterBenefitsLimitationsIncreasing2020). We created a modified version of samSim to support LRP estimation. The LRP version of samSim is described in detail in Appendix  \@ref(app:samsim-appendix), while model code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/samSim/tree/LRP.  


Updated functionality for the LRP version of samSim include:
<!-- KH comment: Not sure if these updates are neccessary here ... this text could be moved to the appendix? - or, just put in the github readme for the LRP branch of samSim?? -->

* The option to sample stock recruitment parameter sets directly from an estimated Bayesian joint posterior distribution.

* The addition of a stock recruitment function that includes an environmental co-variate, as well as specification of future variability in the environmental co-variate (required for Interior Fraser Coho case study).

* The option to initialize population dynamics for individual CUs at unfished equilibrium when no historical recruitment data are available. While this option would not be appropriate for projections aimed at estimating recovery from a current state, it can be used to estimate projection-based LRPs because we are only interested in the underlying relationship between aggregate abundance and the probability individual CUs will be above their lower benchmark.

* The option to include a log-normal bias-correction factor of $-\sigma^2 / 2$ to recruitment projected using one of the two available Ricker stock recruit models. This option was added to accommodate cases in which samSim is parameterized using stock recruitment parameters that have been corrected for log-normal bias to represent expected (mean) parameters. The log-nomral bias correction is commonly applied in stock recruit modelling because the expected value of *e*^$\sigma$ is *e*^$\sigma^2 / 2$} rather than zero when recruitment deviations are normally distributed (@coxCandidateLimitReference2019, @ohlbergerBayesianLifecycleModel2019, @olmosEvidenceSpatialCoherence2019, @forrestAssessmentPacificCod2020, Weir et al., in press). When input parameters have been corrected for this log-normal bias, the bias correction must also be added to projections.  We use a log-normal bias correction factor for all of our case study analyses.

* Specification of variability in exploitation rates as a function of both variability among years and variability among CUs.

Detailed descriptions of the parameterization of samSim for our two case study applications of abundance-based projected LRPs (Interior Fraser Coho and WCVI Chinook) are presented in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. In both cases, we incorporated uncertainty into projected CU dynamics through the specification of empirically-derived probability distributions for key biological and management parameters, including stock-recruitment parameters, proportion of recruits at age, and exploitation rates (ER). Larger structural uncertainties in model formulation were represented through the use of sensitivity analyses and/or alternative operating models (OMs). Observation error was not included in projections because derivation of LRPs was based on projected 'true' abundance levels rather than observed abundance. Furthermore, we were only applying a simple fixed ER harvest strategy when projecting forward, so annual variability arising from observation error would be accounted for by our specification of between-year variability in ERs.  

The following steps were taken to calculate projected LRPs using samSim:

   1. Use samSim to project spawner abundances forward for $nYears$ over $nTrial$ stochastic simulations.


   2. For each simulated year-trial combination, characterize abundances as follows:

      * Assign aggregate SMU level spawner abundance for each year-trial combination to an abundance bin ($AggS_{bin}$), based on intervals of 200 fish . E.g., $AggS_{bin}$ = 0:200 fish, 200:400 fish, 400:600 fish, ... etc.

      * Determine whether all CUs for that year-trial combination were above their CU-level lower benchmarks. If they were, the year-trial combination is scored as a success (1). If they were not, the year-trial combination is scored as a failure (0).


   3. For each aggregate abundance bin, $AggS_{bin}$:

      * Summarize the realized number of year-trial combinations that fell within that bin. For example, if a projection was run for 30 years with 1000 replicates, there might be 200 year-trial combinations that had a aggregate abundance in 10,000 - 12,000 fish bin.
      <!-- CW: Need to check these, It says that fish bins are 200 fish, but example uses 2000 fish bin -->

      * Summarize the number of 'successful' year-trial combinations that occurred for that bin. For example, 50 of 200 year-trial combinations in the aggregate abundance bin of 10,000 - 12,000 fish are successes with all CUs above their lower benchmarks.

      * Calculate the probability that all CUs will be above their lower benchmarks for that bin as:
\begin{equation}
   Pr(All CUs > LBM) = \frac{Number of success in SAgg_{bin}} {Number of realizations in SAgg_{bin}}
   (\#eq:projBins)
\end{equation}
For example, if 50 of the 200 realizations that fell within the $SAgg_{bin}$ of 10,000 - 12,000 fish were 'successes', there would be a 25% probability (50 / 200 = 0.25) that all CUs would be above their lower benchmarks when aggregate abundances are between 10,000 and 12,000 fish.

   4. Identify the LRP as the mid-point of the aggregate abundance bin, $AggS_{bin}$, that is closest to the required probability threshold that all CUs are above their LBMs.

An example of the derivation of an LRP from the projected curve of aggregate abundance bins versus the probability of all CUs being > their lower benchmark is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:example-projectedCurve) for the four probability levels used in our case studies (p* = 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, and 0.99). Uncertainty estimates for LRPs are not available based on this method, but LRP estimates could be presented as a range based on the $SAgg_{bin}$ bin size.
