# REVIEW OF REFERENCE POINTS AND THEIR ROLES FOR PACIFIC SALMON {#review}

<!--\begin{tcolorbox}[sharp corners, boxrule=0.2mm]
\subsection*{Key Points:}

\begin{itemize}

\item The revised Fisheries Act includes new Fish Stocks provisions that introduced legal
obligations to identify limit reference points for major fish stocks prescribed under regulation.

\item Under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock.

\item Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, includes an objective to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon by maintaining and protecting Conservation Units (CUs), the focus of biological assessments under the WSP.

\item The revised *Fisheries Act" indicates that a single LRP is required for each "Major Fish Stock",  defined as Stock Management Units (SMUs) for Pacific salmon, which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve joint status.  

\item This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for management at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain CUs within an SMU above their lower benchmarks under the WSP.

LRPs are commonly used in the assessment and management of marine fisheries where they are used to identify and communicate status and inform harvest control rules as operational control points that trigger changes in target harvest rates or as components of measurable objectives. Reviews of the application of reference points and harvest control rules can be found in @kvamsdalHarvestControlRules2016 and @puntHarvestControlRules2010. @dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015 reviewed the use of harvest control rules and management procedures in data-poor fisheries. In Canada, @sheltonLimitsOverfishingReference2002 provided an overview of the implementation of the precautionary approach and LRPs before the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework in 2009. They highlight that, at that point in time, there was limited evidence of the implementation of the precautionary approach in Canadian fisheries. In contrast, 12 years after the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, a review by @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021 showed that the principles of the Framework, including the adoption of LRPs, are now widespread in the management of Canadian stocks. This review was based on a survey of 177 Canadian stocks of cultural, economic and/or environmental importance, excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks. They identified that 102 stocks had adopted LRPs, although the method used to estimate the LRPs varied considerably among stocks. @kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 also reviewed the use and definition of LRPs in the context of Canadian and international policy. They highlight the importance of embedding LRPs into management objectives with associated tolerance (probability) statements, e.g., "stock status should be maintained above the LRP 90% of the time", as the tolerance statement is required to render the LRP operational. Diagnosing where serious harm is occurring is a pervasive challenge when identifying LRPs, as is addressing the impacts of non-stationarity in underlying biological processes such as natural mortality [@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021].

LRPs and indicators of status can be categorized in ways that demonstrate the diversity of approaches that are available across data types and species life-histories. In particular, LRPs can be derived from theoretical relationships (e.g., stock-recruitment based  reference points), historical patterns (e.g., abundance from which recovery has been observed in the past), or empirical analyses on abundances or life-history traits (Marentette et al. In prep.)^[Marentette, J.R., Barrett, T., Cogliati, K.M., Ings, D., Ladell, J., Thiess, M.  Operationalizing Serious Harm: Existing Guidance and Contemporary Canadian Practices. Can. Sci Avis. Secr. Working Paper In prep.]. For marine fish species, LRPs are typically estimated as a minimum level of spawning biomass (or proxy) that should not be breached [@kronlundSelectionRoleLimit2018; @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021].  @dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009 identifies additional indicators such as catch rate indices, size and age profiles, and sex ratios that "can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition‚Äù [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009].  In general, indicators of status can be categorized as natural metrics (e.g., total abundances or other biological or population characteristics), a proxy for a natural metric (e.g., abundances of indicator stocks), or composite indicators that combine information over multiple dimensions or biological characteristics of status.  


The composite or multidimensional approach for assesing status (sometimes called a "traffic light" approach [@sheltonLimitsOverfishingReference2002]) is particularly useful when theoretical or historical abundance-based metrics are not estimable or not applicable, or when data are limited [@dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015]. Multidimensional approaches allow for consideration of multiple data sources often including expert knowledge to integrate conflicting metrics within assessments. For example, multidimensional reference points have been applied to Snow Crab in Canada, where data on CPUE, egg clutches, and discards are integrated in stock assessments [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018]. Multidimensional approaches can also be useful to address mismatches in scales among biological stocks, the unit of management, and the spatial scale of data collection. These are not uncommon among marine species, especially invertebrate species [@dfoProceedingsNationalPeer2016; @mullowneyBiologicalPerspectivesComplexities2020], creating challenges when identifying LRPs [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. This mismatch can make undesirable states in fish populations difficult to detect, and weaken the effectiveness of resulting management measures.  <!--CH: could include snow crab example from Mullowney et al. 2020 if we wanted to flush this out a bit.

For Pacific salmon, @portleyLimitReferencePoints2014 reviewed the use of LRPs and biological benchmarks in the US (Alaska and Pacific Northwest), Canada, Russia, and Japan. They highlight the role of LRPs and lower benchmarks in allowing for cross-jurisdictional comparisons of sustainability. In Canada, @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 reviewed the use of reference points, including lower benchmarks and LRPs, in the assessment and management of salmonids and other semelparous species. Under Canada's WSP, status assessments generally integrate data across numerous metrics representing different population characteristics, including current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends in abundances, distribution of spawning, and fishing mortality relative to productivity [@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009]. Benchmarks are established for each metric and an overall multidimensional estimate of CU status is obtained by integrating status among metrics [@grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013; @grant2017FraserSockeye2020; @dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015; @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016].  An advantage of this approach is that CUs missing data for any single metric can still be evaluated against remaining metrics, making the framework applicable across a relatively broad range of CUs. Expert-driven processes to integrate often conflicting metrics within the multidimensional framework have been implemented for numerous Pacific salmon stocks in Canada (e.g., Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, *Oncorhynchus nerka* [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011; @grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013; @grant2017FraserSockeye2020], Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, *O. kisutch* [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015], and Southern BC Chinook Salmon, *O. tshawytscha* [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016]). One challenge in implementing these expert-driven processes is high demand on time and staff resources. Based on the consistencies that emerged from assessments where the integration of multiple metrics has been applied, (Pestal et al. In prep.) developed an algorithm to approximate overall WSP status by combining those metrics in a decision tree, at the scale of CUs. This algorithm, known as the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner, was ground-truthed by local assessment experts and tested with stocks not included in the original formulation. 


In some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawner abundances are compared with an abundance-based benchmark have been used as proxies for status outside of DFO [@pacificsalmonfoundationMethodsAssessingStatus2020; @pacificsalmoncommissionChapterPerformanceEvaluation2016]  and occasionally within DFO [e.g., Barkley Sockeye Salmon @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012]. One recommended lower benchmark on spawning abundances under Canada's WSP is S~gen~, the abundance resulting in recovery to S~MSY~ in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. Benchmarks for data-limited contexts have also been identified in recognition that the data required to estimate spawner-recruitment based benchmarks are often not available [@parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006]. See Section \@ref(cu-est-methods). Biological benchmarks are distinguished from triggers in harvest control rules that incorporate additional socio-economic considerations beyond biological considerations [@holtDistinguishingBenchmarksBiological2013a].

## TIME-VARYING PARAMETERS AND IMPACTS ON LRPS

There is increasing evidence of time varying parameters in Pacific salmon populations, particularly relating to trends in productivity [@dornerSpatialTemporalPatterns2018; @malickRegionalScaleDeclinesProductivity2016; @petermanWidespreadDecreaseProductivity2012]. In Canada, DFO assessments identified declines in productivity for various CUs, e.g., Fraser River Sockeye [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011;  @huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021], Southern BC Chinook [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016], and Interior Fraser River Coho [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020]. These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the evaluation of trends in recruits per spawner [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020], evaluation of trends in residuals from recruitment curve fits [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011], and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when fitting recruitment curves using Kalman filter or recursive Bayes approaches [@huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021]. 

Time-varying recruitment parameters affect estimates for salmon benchmarks [e.g., S~MSY~ and S~gen~, @holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020] and are also likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations [e.g., percentile-based benchmarks, @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. Analytical methods for time-varying reference points have been proposed for other marine fish species [@amarEvaluationTwoManagement2009; @puntFisheriesManagementClimate2014], some of which have been evaluated empirically and in simulation with mixed results [@olearyComparisonMultipleApproaches2020; @bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019]. However, determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g., AIC and BIC) often produce conflicting results [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020].  @bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019 suggests that dynamic reference points that track changes in underlying population processes are most useful in situations when stock productivity shifts directionally and the productivity signal is correctly ascertained. In contrast, uncertainty from incorrectly identifying productivity trends can be a major source of inaccuracy in stock status [@bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019]. 

In a review of stock-recruit analyses for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters, @adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 highlighted that even when there is strong evidence for non-stationarity in salmon populations it is not clear if reference points should be adjusted accordingly.  Where stock depletion is associated with time-varying parameters that are thought be reversible, it may be more appropriate to protect the population from harvest by maintaining high reference points using historical data [@dfoProceedingsNationalWorkshop2013; @szuwalskiClimateChangeNonstationary2016]. @dfoHarvestStrategyCompliant2006 recommended that changes to the reference points should only be adjusted when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management. Furthermore, DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework states that "when developing reference points efforts should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available" [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. This information can help identify if reductions in productivity are likely to be irreversible or only slowly reversible. @klaerHowMuchEvidence2015 devised a framework for evaluating the degree of confidence in productivity shifts in Australian fisheries, and similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian salmon populations. 

Even if time-varying benchmarks or reference points are considered, it is difficult to define how often they should be changed [@zhangReportOceanFrontier2021]. Mistimed changes in benchmarks or reference points may lead to bias in stock status [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020] and volatility of management responses may lead to management uncertainty, reducing trust in the management process [@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021]. Recent studies recommend the use of case-specific feedback simulation exercises in order to determine the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non-stationary [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020; @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021; @olearyComparisonMultipleApproaches2020]. However, full feedback simulation studies might not be feasible for every conservation unit where trends are suspected due to limited resources. Future research should focus on identifying general advice on the best practices for adjusting benchmarks when stock dynamics are thought to be non-stationary.   
 

Time-varying stock-recruitment dynamics usually occur at the CU level, and the implications for SMU-based LRPs that contain multiple CUs are not straightforward. There are no clear guidelines on how to translate time-varying stock recruitment parameters for CUs into aggregate-level LRPs. Effects of time-varying CU recruitment dynamics on aggregate abundance- and proportion-based LRPs will depend on the degree of synchrony among CUs, the direction of the change in recruitment parameters, and past and current stock status, among other factors. For example, in our case study on Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, when consistent reductions in productivity were introduced in one sensitivity analysis (analysis that included informative priors on capacity in CU-level spawner-recruitment models), benchmarks declined for most CUs as did aggregate abundance-based LRP for the SMU. However, in cases where productivity varies at different rates among CUs or capacity changes as well, impacts on CU-level benchmarks and SMU-level LRPs will not be easily predictable. 



## ROLE OF LRPS {#roleLRPs}

For marine fish stocks, LRPs have several roles including triggering rebuilding plans under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework @dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009 and the *Fisheries Act*, communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public, and informing management decisions about fisheries. LRPs are biologically based values which can be used to inform fishery management decisions, though their application to management of Pacific salmon is variable. Fisheries management for Pacific salmon is often based on a combination of escapement goals and exploitation limits at a variety of spatial scale. <!-- CH remved based on Sue's comment that this is less relevant for Pacific salmon (and so included the prev 2 sentences intead: "For example, LRPs can be used as part of measurable objectives to identify operational control points which are points where management actions are triggered within harvest control rules, and can also be applied as operational control points themselves. Within a harvest control rule, a conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where serious harm is occurring which can be translated to a measurable objective to avoid spawner abundances lower than an LRP with a high probability (e.g., 95%) over a specified time period.  However, there can be several operational control points in the harvest control rule and these can be positioned to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic objectives beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers and stakeholders. In contrast, DFO's Science Sector is responsible for identifying LRPs based only on biological considerations [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. "-->


In addition, LRPs can be used in performance metrics within a Management Procedure Framework (or Management Strategy Evaluation) to identify those procedures that achieve conservation objectives (e.g., 95% probability of staying above a LRP over a specified period) among other objectives, without being explicitly estimated [@dfoManagementProcedureFramework2021]. This approach includes uncertainties in the biology of the stock, dynamics of the fleet, observation of abundances and associated biological characteristics, and the implementation of management decisions. Simulation evaluation of management procedures is widely viewed as a best practice for informing management decisions under uncertainty [@puntEssentialFeaturesNextgeneration2020a]. For fisheries management systems in which management procedures have been simulation tested, assessment of stock status relative to an LRP is not necessary so long as the management procedure selected has been demonstrated to meet conservation (and possibly other) objectives over a range of modelled scenarios about stock and fishery dynamics.
One advantage of this approach is that a single best underlying model (or LRP) describing the population and fleet dynamics need not be identified. Instead, management procedures can be evaluated against a suite of plausible underlying models or assumptions. Although increasingly common in marine fisheries, the application of a Management Procedure Frameworks is less common for Pacific salmon where the impact of diverse management levers and their interactions are often difficult to quantify [e.g., hatcheries and harvest, though see the AHA model documented by @hsrghatcheryscientificreviewgroupColumbiaRiverHatchery2009]. In addition, salmon stock assessments have typically not integrated uncertainties in estimates of spawner abundances for reference point derivation [but see @scheuerellIntegratedPopulationModel2021 and @statonIncorporatingDemographicInformation2021]. The roles of LRPs will likely evolve for Pacific salmon over time, and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this paper.
