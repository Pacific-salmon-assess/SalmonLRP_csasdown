# PROPOSED LRP METHODS FOR PACIFIC SALMON {#est-methods}

LRP methods require assessments of status at the scale of CUs. Abundance data required for CU assessments are sometimes influenced by hatchery enhancement, which requires additional considerations. This section includes recommended methods to derive CU-level statuses and estimates LRPs. Within CU status assessments, we first describe our approach for accounting for hatchery enhancement.<!--CH omit?  Candidate LRPs are based on either the proportion of CUs with status above the Red zone or aggregate abundances to the SMU. -->

## CONTRIBUTION OF HATCHERIES

\begin{tcolorbox}[sharp corners, boxrule=0.2mm]
\subsection*{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item While hatcheries are a useful tool for augmenting production for harvest and conservation, they can reduce wild genetic diversity and fitness and are considered a risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs.
\item Salmon that are enhanced by hatcheries are not considered 'wild' under the Wild Salmon Policy and are not usually included in assessments of biological status.
\item The data used to assess the contribution of hatcheries to spawning are associated with high uncertainties related to the tagging method used, sampling rates, uncertainty in survival of natural vs. hatchery-origin fish, and observation errors.
\item Populations dominated by wild fish but influenced by hatchery strays from outside of the basin are generally included in CU assessments, but these strays may bias estimates of natural production and resulting assessments. 
\item Following previous WSP status assessments, when data are available, the demographic influence of hatchery production can be removed from time-series of abundances. This step applies to populations included in analyses, after removing populations with high hatchery influence. Where data to differentiate hatchery- from natural-origin spawners are not available, total spawner abundances include hatchery-origin fish, representing a key source of uncertainty for hatchery-influenced populations.
\item Methods to process data on hatchery contributions within assessments and guidance on best practices within DFO continue to evolve.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

Hatcheries contribute to spawning abundances of many salmon populations and can be used as a conservation tool as well as a way to increase the availability of fish for harvest. Hatcheries can also reduce wild genetic diversity and fitness, defined as adult-to-adult reproductive success, and are considered a risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Salmon that are hatchery-origin, as well as their progeny, are not considered 'wild' under the Wild Salmon Policy. Typically, only populations dominated by wild salmon are included in assessments of biological status. However, separating out the influence of hatcheries in time-series of spawner abundances and recruitment is challenging, in part because hatchery-origin salmon are often not marked, e.g., with fin clips or fish tags, and so are indistinguishable from natural-origin spawners. Also, many salmon escapement programs, such as those where salmon spawners are counted from helicopters [@parkenIncorporatingUncertaintyArea2003] do not have biological sampling programs to collect, mark and tag data from individual salmon. 

### Accounting for genetic risks of hatchery production

Following @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018, we recommend including only populations without significant hatchery enhancement in analyses of CU and SMU biological status consistent with the WSP. Proportionate Natural Influence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural populations, with values $<$ 0.5 indicating integrated-hatchery populations, where more than half of spawners are hatchery origin, values $\geqslant$ 0.5 and $<$ 0.72 indicating integrated-transition populations where natural-origin fish predominate, and values $\geqslant$ 0.72 indicating integrated-wild populations, where more than half of spawners are considered 'wild' under the WSP [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. While these guidelines were proposed for Chinook Salmon where hatchery enhancement is most common, they are also applicable to other salmon species [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018] <!--(Table \@ref(tab:PNIcategories)). -->

\end{longtable}


When assessing population status, @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018 recommend the inclusion of integrated-wild populations within biological assessments under the WSP, and provisionally, integrated-transition populations (i.e., PNI  $\geqslant$ 0.5 ). Accordingly, only populations with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.5 were included in the assessment of CU and SMU status in our case study applications. Stricter definitions of hatchery enhancement can be considered by including only populations with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.72. In practice, applying this stricter threshold for our case study on Chinook Salmon resulted in excluding most data since reliable time-series of PNI values and spawner abundances are only available for exploitation-rate indicator populations<!--where coded-wire tags have been applied and sampled for recoveries-->, which tend to be populations with hatcheries. Adopting a threshold of $\geqslant$ 0.5, a level associated with more than half of spawners being natural origin, was the result of a trade-off between assessing remaining CU-level biodiversity and excluding significant hatchery impacts. For some populations, early periods of high enhancement can be removed from time-series and assessments can focus on recent periods without significant enhancement [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2012]. For hatcheries aimed at rebuilding critically depleted populations, production may be dominated by hatchery-origin fish for a period until abundances are above lower conservation thresholds. Guidelines on the assessment and management of these conservation hatcheries are currently being developed by DFO's Salmonid Enhancement Program, including regular assessments of the proportion of hatchery-origin spawning.


Data used to assess hatchery contribution to spawning and estimate PNI values are associated with high uncertainties. For our case study on Chinook Salmon, <!--KH: coho uses CWTs, so perhaps just leave as WCVI chinook since this is the focus on this paragraph? Or, could add a follow-up sentence about CWT for coho?? CH: will leave for now-->proportions of hatchery-origin spawners were determined from spawning ground surveys for thermal marking on hatchery-origin salmon. When data on thermal marking were not available, coded-wire tags (CWTs) were used to identify hatchery-origin spawners, but were associated with increased uncertainty. Large interannual variability in the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners can result from natural variability in survival of hatchery- versus natural-origin spawners, low sampling rates for hatchery-origin spawners, and high observation errors, requiring decisions about temporal averaging. For the westcoast Vancouver Island Chinook case study, we averaged over the available time series where hatchery objectives have remained constant, though recommend further research quantifying the sources of uncertainties and evaluating the sensitivity of results to various time periods for averaging (e.g., recent generation versus entire time period). 


In addition to guidance on biological assessments under the WSP, @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018 further recommend developing biological goals for hatchery-influenced populations and documenting trade-offs between increased genetic risk to wild populations from hatchery production and increased abundance required to support other objectives. Enhancement plans are being developed for hatchery-influenced populations by DFO's Salmonid Enhancement Program, which include objectives related to PNI, harvest, assessment, and stewardship and measures to achieve objectives. Once developed, enhancement plans can be integrated with harvest and habitat planning within integrated management and/or rebuilding plans. Guidelines and methods for estimating PNI values are also being documented by DFO's Salmonid Enhancement Program (DFO, In revision)^[DFO In revision. Guidelines for Calculating the Proportionate Natural Influence Index as a Metric of the Genetic Influence of Enhanced Pacific Salmon on Wild Populations. Report of the Salmonid Enhancement Program, Vancouver, BC]. 

### Wild populations influenced by straying from hatcheries

In addition, @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018 recommend that populations dominated by wild fish but influenced by hatchery stays (called 'wild stray-influenced' populations) should be included in CU assessments under the WSP. These populations receive strays from out-of-basin hatchery programs, but do not contain hatcheries themselves. Although the majority of fish may be wild in these populations, one-way gene flow modelling suggests that over time PNI values will decline to levels consistent with hatchery-dominated systems with continued straying. In practice, straying from out-of-basin hatcheries and the genetic impacts are generally not monitored or assessed, and so out-of-basin strays are included in total abundances within biological assessments. However, this represents a gap in our knowledge of hatchery impacts and our ability to implement recommendations from @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018.  Two exceptions are @candyPatternsHomingStraying2000 which describes patterns of straying of Chinook salmon in the Fraser watershed and Vancouver Island, and more thoroughly on the west coast of Vancouver Island where studies estimating the extent of straying for Chinook Salmon are on-going and may inform the evaluation of hatchery impacts in future biological assessments (W. Luedke pers. comm.). 


### Removing the demographic influence of hatchery production

For some WSP assessments that include integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations, the demographic influence of hatchery production is removed from time-series of abundances when data on the proportion of hatchery- versus natural-origin fish on the spawning grounds are available [e.g., from marking of hatchery-origin fish or other data on the relative survival of hatchery-origin fish, @dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015]. Specifically, the contribution of hatchery-origin production is removed from both the benchmark estimation and metric of spawner abundance. For stock-recruitment based benchmarks, the contribution of hatchery-origin fish is removed from recruitment estimates but not escapement, as it is assumed that all natural spawners reproduce successfully in the wild and contribute to natural production. This way, the spawner-recruitment relationship represents the production derived from spawners in the natural environment. For the metric of spawner abundances, the contribution of hatchery-origin fish can be removed from spawner time series to reduce the influence of variability in annual hatchery production on status [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015]. Although removing hatchery-origin fish from analyses is inconsistent with the recommendation of @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018 to include all spawners in biological assessments when natural spawning predominates (PNI $\geqslant$ 0.5), it is consistent with existing published WSP assessments on which our analyses relied and developing new time-series was beyond the scope of this study.


In most cases where hatchery-origin fish are not marked or sampled on the spawning grounds, data on the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available. In these cases, WSP assessments generally rely on total spawner abundances including hatchery contribution, as long as spawner abundances are believed to be predominantly natural origin (e.g., PNI $\geqslant$ 0.5) [e.g., Southern BC Chinook Salmon, @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016], aligned with recommendations of @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018. In these cases, there may a risk of current status being confounded by hatchery production which may mask changes in natural production production and obscure inferences for unenhanced populations in the CU. This risk is partly mediated but not eliminated by removing populations that are dominated by hatchery-origin fish from assessments. In general, we recommend flexibility in addressing hatchery-influenced populations in assessments as methods to process hatchery-origin fish and associated guidance evolve.



<!--CH remove, replaced with pgh above: In addition, some populations without hatcheries may be influenced by straying from hatcheries from neighbouring populations ('out-of-basin' strays). In this case, a very large fraction of fish may be wild, however, if straying continues over time , gene flow modelling shows that that the genetic influence of hatcheries will increase as well [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018].The impact of these strays is generally excluded in assessments in part because of the absence of marking and spawning ground sampling for hatchery fish or genetic analyses to determine their influence, and so out-of-basin strays are included in total abundances. Studies evaluating the extent of straying for Chinook Salmon for the West Coast of Vancouver Island are on-going (W. Luedke pers. comm.) and previous research by Candy and Beacham (2000) described the patterns in Southern BC.

<!--CH removed: "Recruitment data are generally not available for these stocks, so stock-recruitment analyses are usually not implemented. In one exception for Pitt River Sockeye Salmon,  spawner abundances were determined from brood take plus total spawners in the natural environment and recruitment was total recruits from both hatchery and natural environment (Pitt River, Grant et al. 2011)".-->
## ESTIMATION OF CU STATUS {#cu-est-methods}

\begin{tcolorbox}[sharp corners, boxrule=0.2mm]
\subsection*{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item We recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated through formal status assessments or through the \textbf{Pacific Salmon Status Scanner tool}, also called the Salmon Scanner.
\item The Salmon Scanner provides status from a composite of metrics and benchmarks on spawner abundances, and long- and short-term trends in spawner abundances.
\item Various benchmarks on spawner abundances have been identified to account for differences in data types, quantities and qualities among CUs, including those based on stock-recruitment relationships, percentiles of historical spawner abundances and freshwater spawning and rearing capacity.
\item Distributional metrics of spawning have been included in formal WSP assessments.
\item For the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses were derived in two ways: using multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on spawner abundances to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches and highlight any differences.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
<!--CH removed from bullet 4 on distribution: ", but have not yet been incorporated into the Salmon Scanner, in part due to a lack of rigorous benchmarks on these metrics"-->

<!-- KH: I have expanded on the following paragraph as a revision from CSAS meeting-->
To be consistent with the multidimensional approach to WSP status assessments described in @holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009, we recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated through formal status assessments [@grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013; @grant2017FraserSockeye2020; @dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015; @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016] or through other multidimensional approaches like the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner (Pestal et al. In prep.). In our case study applications (Holt et al., In prep), we demonstrate the application of the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner tool as a way to rapidly approximate more detailed WSP status assessments. The  Salmon Scanner (i) estimates statuses for individual WSP metrics and (ii) applies a decision tree algorithm to integrate multiple status estimates into a single status estimate (e.g., Red, Amber, Green) based on data type and availability. By using multiple metrics (Table \@ref(tab:SSmetrics)), the Salmon Scanner allows for the assessment of status across a wide range of data availabilities. When data for a single metric are not available, other metrics can be used to inform status. The decision tree algorithm was verified with data and local expertise (Pestal et al. in prep). An expert review of rapid status results for each CU is intended to be incorporated into the application of this tool (S. Grant, pers. comm.).  The Salmon Scanner can provide assessments under data limitations, and methods to account for resulting uncertainties from these data limitations are currently being integrated into the Scanner. 

<!--KH: if these methods to account for uncertainties haven't been developed yet (i.e., aren't yet written up in a draft paper), I'm not sure we should mention them.   
CH: the challenge is I had original text saying the Salmon Scanner did not incorporate uncertainties in underlying metrics, but Sue mentioned that its being developed and so it's not really a disadvantage-->

\normalsize Various benchmarks on spawner abundances have been identified to account for differences in data types, quantities and qualities among CUs. For data-rich CUs where spawner-recruitment relationships can be reliably estimated, @holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009 recommend a lower benchmark at the abundance resulting in recovery to spawner abundances at maximum sustained yield, S~MSY~, in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, S~gen~. When applying stock-recruitment analyses, the spatial scale of density dependence should be carefully considered, which may be smaller or larger than the CU. Where recruitment time-series are not available and productivity is assumed to be moderate or high, and harvest rates moderate or low, specified percentiles of observed spawner time-series (e.g., 25^th^) can be used as a proxy for spawner-recruitment benchmarks [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. For Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho Salmon where production is often limited by the quantity of freshwater habitat, equilibrium spawner abundances can be predicted from habitat characteristics to inform abundance-based benchmarks [@nobleHabitatbasedEscapementBenchmarks2015; @parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006]. For example, @parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006 use the relationship between watershed area and spawner-recruitment based reference points in a meta-analysis of Chinook Salmon populations<!--LW: changed from stocks. Paper uses the word stock but I think they are different than SMUs or CUs (pre-CU and SMU definitions)--> from across the Pacific region to predict reference points for Chinook populations<!--LW: changed from stocks--> without recruitment data. Also, information on freshwater habitat capacity can be used to develop informative priors for stock-recruitment benchmarks estimated with Bayesian techniques (e.g., @atlasLandscapeBiophysicalControls2020 for Sockeye Salmon).

Similarly, metrics and benchmarks on long-term and short-term trends in spawner abundances are included in the Salmon Scanner. Long-term trends are measured by the ratio of recent generational geometric average spawner abundances relative to the long-term geometric average, and short-term trends are measured as the percent change in spawner abundances over 3 generations, the time period used in COSEWIC assessments [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. Lower benchmarks on these metrics represent levels below which there is increased risk of extinction [@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009]. <!--CH: I feel like this is repetitive given the table, but Sue asked for a more balanced description of metrics and benchmarks, covering all categories...-->

In addition, metrics on the distribution of spawning within a CU can be considered in WSP assessments [@peacockReviewMetricsDistribution2010; @peacockMetricsSamplingDesigns2012; @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016], but may not be required for all salmon species and to-date have not been included in the Salmon Scanner. In one example, the distribution of spawners across spawning sites and contractions in that distribution over time were considered in a WSP assessment for southern BC Chinook [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016]. In addition, recovery targets for Interior Fraser Coho account for the distribution of spawners among sub-populations  [@interiorfrasercohorecoveryteamConservationStrategyCoho2006]. One challenge to applying metrics on distribution is identifying benchmarks that distinguish populations with increased risk of extinction.

For the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses for case study applications were derived in two ways, using the multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on spawner abundances. We applied both to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches and highlight any differences. When only a single metric is applied to derive status, there is a risk of providing a misleading assessment if other metrics that would have been used in a multidimensional approach provide contrary information, but are not included. A full review of the Salmon Scanner will be provided in Pestal et al. (In prep.).

<!--CH omitting becuase it pertains only to sensitivity analysis on proportinal LRPs, not aggregate abundance LRPs, which is confusing!  I've revised this text to refer to generational mean of SMU abundances relative to LRP, and moved to Step 9 of the Guidelines.

When assessing CU status relative to abundance-based lower benchmarks, we use generational mean spawner abundances as a basis for determining whether each CU is above or below its lower benchmark. Taking the generational mean integrates status over cohorts within a generation, which can exhibit relatively independent dynamics in some species. This approach reduces noise in annual CU status determination due to annual fluctuations in CU abundances from any single cohort. It also makes our determination of CU status consistent with the approach taken for abundance-based benchmarks in WSP assessments and the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner.

## LRP ESTIMATION

\begin{tcolorbox}[sharp corners, boxrule=0.2mm]
\subsection*{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{CU status-based LRPs} are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above Red status, with 100\% as the recommended LRP.
\item CU status-based LRPs are recommended as the default approach for estimating LRPs for Pacific salmon and triggering rebuilding plans under the \textit{Fisheries Act}.
\item LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU-level abundances (\textbf{'aggregate abundance LRPs'}) may be required for fisheries management decisions at the SMU scale, and are considered supplemental to CU status-based LRPs.
\item Two types of aggregate abundance LRPs are identified: \textbf{logistic regression LRPs} and \textbf{projection LRPs}. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Both rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses of component CUs, but logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical data directly whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics, usually parameterized from empirical data.  
\item Both aggregate abundance LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs achieving status above Red.
\end{itemize}
\item An assumption of the logistic regression LRPs is that the relationship between aggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically represents the current (and future) relationship. If the covariance in population dynamics among CUs is non-stationary, logistic regression LRPs may not represent levels above serious harm. 
\item Projection LRPs can integrate plausible ranges of parameter uncertainties that may differ from those observed historically, unlike logistic regression LRPs.
 
\end{itemize} 
\end{tcolorbox}

<!--
Additional points to add for the SAR:
\item Advantages of CU status-based LRPs include that they are consistent with the established framework for status assessments under the WSP, they are easy to communicate, and the spatial scale of CU status-based LRPs can be easily adapted to match the scale at which management decisions are required.
\item For projection LRPs, there is no uncertainty from statistical estimation, unlike logistic regression LRPs. Probabilities are derived directly from projections and underlying uncertainties are integrated directly into the overall probability.
\item For both aggregate abundance LRPs, uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks and assessments can be accounted for explicitly and quantitatively.
\item Also for both aggregate abundance LRPs, structural uncertainty in underlying population dynamics can be considered through sensitivity analyses or model averaging across structural assumptions.


-->
In this section, LRPs that integrate statuses of component CUs are proposed. These LRPs fall into two categories: those based on the proportion of component CUs above the Red zone, called CU status-based LRPs, and those based on aggregate abundances, called aggregate abundance LRPs.  Aggregate abundance LRPs are further subdivided into logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs (Fig. \@ref(fig:LRP-types)). A more detailed description of LRPs is included in Holt et al. (In review).

### CU status-based LRPs

CU status-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above Red status (Fig. \@ref(fig:CU-status-based-LRP)). To be consistent with the intent of the WSP to preserve biodiversity at the CU-level, we identify an LRP at 100% of CUs having status above Red (i.e., either Amber or Green). <!--CH Sue suggested removing as she wasn't sure what happened when LRP is breached, I think. I agree the act of breaching is not entirely relevant here, but I did think it might help explain the CU status-based LRP "When any individual CU falls into the Red zone, then the LRP is considered breached."--> See Section \@ref(guidelines) for a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs that further considers data limitations when identifying the proportion of CUs above the Red zone, and Section \@ref(recommendations) for a description of associated uncertainties. CU statuses are derived using the approaches described in Section \@ref(cu-est-methods), and are submitted to peer review, as described in Section \@ref(guidelines).




<!--CH: the following 2 lines give a line break before the next heading-->
\
&nbsp;
*Alignment with LRP Principles*

CU status-based LRPs can be based on the best available information (Principle 1) by incorporating multiple dimensions of status through formal, peer-reviewed WSP status assessments or the use of the Salmon Scanner with peer review. By using status derived from the annual implementation of the Salmon Scanner, relevant and timely information is used to inform status in a way that is transparent and open. CU status-based LRPs represent serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated by the status of any one component CU within the SMU being in the Red zone under the WSP, given that the deterioration of stock structure (i.e., loss of diversity) can itself be a form of serious harm. CU status-based LRPs are operational (Principle 3) because they are simple to calculate and communicate as a proportion of CU statuses. For SMUs where harvest is managed at the aggregate SMU scale, however, CU status-based LRPs are not easily incorporated into harvest control rules at that scale. Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends in part on the underlying data and is CU- and SMU-dependent. Uncertainties are not currently propagated from CU-level benchmarks and statuses from the Salmon Scanner, to LRPs and SMU statuses (Principle 5).  CU status-based LRPs are well aligned with Principle 6, being derived directly from WSP metrics of status for CUs.

A further advantage of this method is that it can easily be extended to other spatial scales under which Pacific salmon are managed. For example, CUs can be assessed individually when threats and responses are localized to specific watersheds, e.g., Cultus Sockeye which has unique threats to its spawning and rearing habitats. CU status can also be aggregated at various scales and across species when threats and responses are broader, e.g, for the management of numerous salmon species and CUs impacted by the Big Bar landslide reported in 2019.  

<!--CH: the following 2 lines give a line break before the next heading-->
\
&nbsp;
In addition to CU status-based LRPs, we developed LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU-level abundance accounting for component CU-level statuses. These 'aggregate abundance LRPs' may be required for fisheries management decisions at the SMU scale, but are considered supplemental to CU status-based LRPs for the purposes of the Fish Stocks provisions. We identified two types of aggregate abundance LRPs: (1) logistic regression LRPs and (2) projection LRPs (Fig. \@ref(fig:LRP-types)). Both LRPs rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses of the component CUs, but they differ in that logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical data directly, whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics usually parameterized from empirical data.  Also, both LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs achieving status above the Red zone. To an extent uncertainty in the underlying relationship between observed aggregate abundances and component CU-level statuses is represented in the probabilistic nature of these LRPs; larger uncertainties result in higher LRP values and vice versa, all else remaining equal. The ability of aggregate-abundance LRPs to reliably represent thresholds of serious harm at the CU level depend on the strength of the underlying relationship between aggregate abundance and CU statuses as inferred from observed data.

### Aggregate Abundance LRPs

**Logistic regression LRPs**

Logistic regression LRPs can be derived from an empirically estimated relationship between CU-level statuses and aggregate SMU abundance. This method extends the CU status-based LRP by identifying the aggregate abundance level that has historically been associated with all component CUs having status above the Red zone, as approximated from status on a single metric of spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. For each year of observed data, SMU-level status is quantified as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have estimated status greater than the lower benchmark and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have status greater than the lower benchmark, i.e., at least one CU was assessed below the lower benchmark. A logistic regression is then fit to these outcomes to estimate the probability that all CUs have abundances above their lower benchmarks as a function of aggregate SMU-level spawner abundances. Given the difference in number of component CUs among salmon species (more for Sockeye Salmon than for other species), the likelihood of at least one component CU having Red status is greater for Sockeye. The following logistic regression equation is used to estimate LRPs,

\begin{equation}
  \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = B_0 + B_1 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t}
   (\#eq:logistic)
\end{equation}

where, $p$ is probability, $B_0$ and $B_1$ are estimated logistic regression parameters and $S_{i,t}$ is spawner abundance to CU $i$ in year $t$. Equation \@ref(eq:logistic) is then re-arranged to calculate the LRP as the aggregate spawner abundance associated with the pre-specified probability threshold of $p^*$,

\begin{equation}
  LRP = \frac{log(\frac{p^*}{1-p^*}) - B_0}{B_1}
  (\#eq:logisticLRP)
\end{equation}

An example logistic regression fit is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:example-logisticFit), with LRPs associated with four probability thresholds, 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, 0.99, representing minimum levels above which probabilities are more likely than not, likely, very likely, and virtually certain, respectively, as defined by the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC [@mastrandreaGuidanceNoteLead2010, Table \@ref(tab:LikelihoodsIPCC)]. @mastrandreaGuidanceNoteLead2010 also highlight the range 33%-66% as representing 'as likely as not', encompassing probabilities slightly above even (50%-66%). The mid-point at 50% represents an equal probability that all CUs will be above Red status as there is that they will not. <!-- CH omit: While DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009] provides draft risk categories, with ~50% described as neutral, 50-75% described as 'moderately high', and "75%-95% as 'high', these pertain to specifically to preventable declines and may not be relevant for LRP estimation. -->An additional consideration in this step is the probability threshold for triggering LRPs described in DFO's Guidelines for the Implementation of Rebuilding Plans [@dfoScienceGuidelinesSupport2021].  These guidelines specify that, "unless otherwise defined in stock-specific precautionary approach frameworks, the LRP should be considered breached if the terminal year stock status indicator is estimated to be at or below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability or if the projected stock status indicator falls below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability under a zero catch scenario in a 1 year projection". While using a 50% probability threshold of one or more CUs having Red status is not directly analogous, in both cases the probability threshold chosen represents the probability of the stock avoiding serious harm.

We recommend positioning LRPs as thresholds with at least a 50% probability of all component CUs being above Red status, but do not recommend a specific probability level above that minimum.  Instead, we demonstrate LRPs under various choices of probability levels. Although LRPs are intended to be identified by Science to represent the best scientific estimate of the level below which serious harm is expected to occur [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021] and without necessarily introducing additional precaution under uncertainty,<!--ref? CH: I realize this would benefit from a reference, but all I have is Rob Kronlund pers. comm....--> there is no scientific basis to choose one probability over others. We distinguish the biological basis of serious harm (any one CU having Red status) from the probability of this occurring, which implies a decision about risk tolerance.


<!--KH: when descibing our propbability thresholds above and in the following table, it may be worth noting that the values we selected were either mid-points or lower ends of the IPCC probability ranges.  Text from the case study paper that does this is as follows:

"The 50% value represents the mid-point of the "About as likely as not" category (33 - 66%), indicating that there is an equal probability that all CUs will be above their LBMs as there is that they will not. The 66% values represents the lower end of the "Likely" category (i.e., it is "Likely" that all CUs will be above their LBMs), the 90% value represents the lower end of the "Very Likely" category, and the 99% value represents the "Virtually Certain" category." 

I will leave it to you to change the table if you agree though because I don't want to make a mess.

CH: I think the inital description covers this? ".5, 0.66, 0.90, 0.99, representing minimum levels above which probabilities are more likely than not, likely, very likely, and virtually certain, respectively,". I have added another row to the table.

<!-- 
Also, based on the IUCN probability categories in case studies paper section 2.3, wouldn't we at least recommend that a probability over 50% be chosen, since 50% is 'as likely as not'? Wouldn't the precautionary principle lead us to recommend at least something in the 'likely' category >66%? This would be informed by the precautionary approach, and http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/CP22-70-2003E.pdf.  I find it hard to justify the statement that there is no scientific basis to choose one probability over the others, since we have other guidance to go on. Additionally, the idea that the LRP should be above the level where serious harm is occurring makes me think that something at least in the likely category, if not the 90% very likely category, be recommended.
CH: good points Luke. Also, rebuilding guidance (DFO 2021) suggests precaution should be built into the management system and not the trigger for rebuilding.  i.e., 10% probability of breaching the LRP is not a breach. They suggest 50% probability is appropriate, which makes me wary about choosing a higher %. However, as you suggested, I have revised the text to say we recommend at least a 50% probability. 
Another challenge when applying these choices to logistic regression-based LRPs is that high probabilities, the curve is quite flat, so the difference between an LRP at p=0.9 and 0.95 can be double or more in value for LRP-- so really hard to justify one value over the other. However at p=0.5, the curve is steep, so changing from p=0.4-0.6 doesn't really matter for the LRP.
-->
Uncertainty in logistic regression LRP estimates can be quantified based on confidence or credible intervals on the LRP estimate. See our application to Interior Fraser Coho Salmon for an example (Holt et al. In review).

We recommend evaluating the fit of the logistic regression prior to the development of LRPs to identify its reliability in determining serious harm to component CUs. Diagnostics commonly used for logistic regression of Bernoulli distributed data are provided in Holt et al. (In review). For example, diagnostics can evaluate the assumptions that, (a) aggregate abundances are linearly related to log-odds of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, (b) observations are independent, and (c) there are no influential outliers. In addition, the statistical significance of the predictor variable (aggregate abundance) and the goodness-of-fit of the logistic model can inform its reliability for determining LRPs. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of LRPs developed from a logistic regression can be evaluated on the observed data using a performance metric called the hit ratio. This ratio represents the proportion of successful classifications above or below the logistic regression-derived LRP, relative to the total number classifications or years.  Out-of-sample cross-validation methods can also be applied so that model-based LRPs do not include the observed data used for evaluation in this performance metric.


We used a single metric of annual spawner abundances to approximate CU status when using the logistic regression approach, though WSP assessments generally use multiple metrics including trends in abundances and apply generational smoothing. Incorporating metrics on trends and smoothing abundance time-series prior to determining CU status introduces autocorrelation in observed CU statuses, violating the assumption of independent observations in the logistic regression model. This creates a systematic difference in derivation of LRPs depending on how CU status is assessed. Future research could consider logistic regression models that include autocorrelated residuals to develop LRPs based on CU-statuses derived from multiple metrics (e.g., the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner).


One advantage of logistic regression LRPs is that uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks and assessments can be accounted for explicitly. We used a statistically integrated estimation approach, where CU-level stock-recruitment models and associated CU-level benchmarks were estimated in the same model as the logistic regression and LRP derivation. In this way, the uncertainties from CU-level benchmarks and assessments were propagated through to the estimation of the LRP. While Bayesian estimation methods were not applied for the integrated logistic regression approach in any of our case study applications, this extension could be made in the future.  <!--CH omit?: The probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks in a given year can be predicted from aggregate abundance, with the predicted probability explicitly accounting for uncertainty in CU-level assessments against lower benchmarks.-->  

In addition, structural uncertainties in underlying assumptions<!--required when developing CU-level benchmarks--> such as the form of the spawner-recruitment relationship, can be addressed in at least three ways. First, the weight-of-evidence for various assumptions can be evaluated to identify the assumption with the most support, which is then used for LRP development. This can include relying on support for various model forms provided in previous stock assessments or from meta-analyses. Second, various assumptions can be provided as sensitivity analyses demonstrating the impact of assumptions about CU dynamics on LRP estimates and current status. Third, LRPs can be averaged by, for example, combining posterior probability estimates. When averaging, LRPs can be weighted according to the inverse of the variances, the strength of evidence for each hypothesis based on statistical criteria (e.g., AIC), retrospective performance, or expert opinion [@rossiInferringFisheriesStock2019; @jardimOperationalizingEnsembleModels2021]. A simple example of model-averaging, in which two alternative models were weighted equally, was demonstrated for projection LRPs in the Interior Fraser Coho case study. When model averaging, it is important to consider the plausibility of various models and the distribution of uncertain parameters (e.g., their variances and biases)[@dormannModelAveragingEcology2018; @millarModelAveragingStreamline2015]. It may be more appropriate to select one model instead of averaging over models when they provide competing hypotheses (i.e., bimodal distributions) with differing management implications [@millarModelAveragingStreamline2015].

*Alignment with LRP Principles*

Logistic regression LRPs do not use the best available information for CU statuses in all cases (Principle 1), because they use only one metric of spawner abundances omitting metrics on trends which may be especially informative in data-limited contexts. CUs that do not have abundance-based benchmarks are omitted from consideration of serious harm in this approach even when trends are available to estimate status. Also, logistic regression LRPs approximate CU status by comparing annual spawner abundances to benchmarks instead of generationally smoothed spawner abundances and so may capture random noise in abundance trends instead of true status that is likely autocorrelated over time. In some cases, status based on the single metric on spawner abundances may diverge from that based on multidimensional approaches, e.g., the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner. Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 2 to the extent that serious harm is indicated by status of any one CU being in the Red zone under the WSP and that the estimated relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark holds. 

Logistic regression LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when harvest management occurs at the aggregate level and requires aggregate abundance LRPs to inform management decisions. However, they are more difficult to communicate being derived from model outputs, and they require the choice of probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, which is difficult to justify from a science perspective. <!--CH removed since it's mostly repeated in the next pgh: "Logistic-regression based LRPs may not be appropriate operationally if new management procedures are applied that result in changes in covariance in dynamics among CUs. For fisheries without a history of weak-stock management the assumption of stationarity in covariance in exploitation may hold, as in Interior Fraser River Coho, supporting their application of logistic regression approaches to identify recovery targets."-->


Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the reliability of underlying data and the fit of logistic regression as described by model diagnostics. <!--For this method, uncertainties can be propagated from CU-level benchmarks and status to LRPs.  -->One assumption of this method is that the relationship between aggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically represents the current (and future) relationship. If the covariance in dynamics among CUs or relative productivities or capacities of CUs are non-stationary, a phenomenon that is increasingly common for Pacific salmon, logistic regression LRPs may not reliably represent serious harm under current or future conditions. Furthermore, LRPs may be unreliable if harvest strategies change over time such that relative exploitation of CUs varies (e.g., due to shifts towards weak stock management or when exploitation varies with the abundance of other species).  Uncertainties in CU status are accounted for explicitly when CU- and SMU-level models are statistically integrated, and confidence or credible intervals can provide quantitative measures of estimation uncertainty (Principle 5). Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are an acceptably reliable predictor of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU status on a single metric may deviate from the multidimensional approach recommended under the WSP.

<!--CH: moved to uncertainties section in last chapter "Also, it is not possible to assess sensitivity of LRPs to  structural assumptions about covariance in population dynamics among CU and the relationship between aggregate abundances and CU statuses, as the LRP depends only on the logistic fit to observed data." -->

**Projection LRPs** 

Similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs rely on the underlying relationship between aggregate abundances and status of component CUs. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs, the aggregate abundance where there is a specified probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks is identified from projections instead of directly from historical data.   

In this approach, the population dynamics of individual CUs are projected with natural variability in population processes (e.g., recruitment and ages-at-maturity) and with covariance among CUs. Projections are done using current exploitation rates characterized with annual implementation uncertainty. Other exploitation scenarios can also be considered. Projections are run over an initialization period to remove the impacts of starting conditions, and then over multiple generations to identify aggregate abundances characterized by an equilibrium state where the distribution of abundances are stable. Projection LRPs are then estimated using these projected CU abundances to characterize the relationship between aggregate SMU-level spawner abundance and the probability that all CUs exceed their lower benchmarks (e.g., S~gen~). For the SMUs we considered for our case studies, we approximated the management approach with constant exploitation rates with implementation error, though more realistic management procedures that include escapement goals and exploitation limits, or a fixed series of exploitation rates that vary with abundances could be considered in future iterations.  <!-- CW: many salmon stocks are managed through input (effort) control rather than output control (e.g. TACs), so perhaps okay to model MP with a fixed ER model + implementation uncertainty, even though the fixed ER HCR is not actually part of the management objective-->As was done for logistic regression LRPs, status was estimated from a single metric rather than from the multidimensional approach within the Salmon Scanner. <!--KH: I would take out the following part of this sentence.  Because we always had abundance-based benchmarks for our true populations (i.e., er knew Sgen), we wouldn't have applied trends even if we used the multidimensional approach. Plus, we could have chosen to apply the absolute thresholds of 1500 fish in projections, but we didn't --> <!--omitted text: because the projections are meant to capture equilibrium conditions and are not appropriate for identifying status on temporal trends which are included as metrics in the Scanner. -->

One advantage of projection LRPs over logistic regression LRPs is that projections allow for explicit consideration of uncertainty in underlying assumptions about model parameters and the covariance among CUs by including those uncertainties as random components of the projections. Furthermore, unlike logistic regression LRPs, this method is not limited by historical data on CU status. To implement projection LRPs, we adapted a previously developed R package for performing closed-loop simulation modelling, samSim [@holtQuantitativeToolEvaluating2020; @freshwaterBenefitsLimitationsIncreasing2020], as described in the Appendix to Holt et al. (In review) and provided online (see Appendix \@ref(app:links)).  

After providing parameter distributions describing the CU-level population dynamics and exploitation to samSim, the projections included four main steps:

1. Project spawner abundances forward for 30 years after an initialization period and over $nTrial$ stochastic simulations, where $nTrials$ was chosen to stabilize results. In preliminary analyses, we projected over 100 years and found similar results. 
   
2. For each simulated year-trial combination after initialization, characterize abundances as follows:

      * Assign aggregate SMU level spawner abundance for each year-trial combination to an abundance bin based on intervals of 200 fish, e.g., 0:200, 201:400, 401:600, etc.

      * Determine whether all CUs for each year-trial combination were above their CU-level lower benchmarks on abundances, or not.
      
3. For each aggregate abundance bin, calculate the proportion for year-trial combinations where all CUs were above their lower benchmark relative to all year-trial combinations falling in that bin. These proportions are then plotted against the aggregated abundances for year bin (taken as the mid-point of the bin).
      
4. Identify the LRP as the mid-point of the aggregate abundance bin with a proportion of CUs above their lower benchmark that is closest to the desired probability threshold (e.g., 0.5, 0.66, 0.9, or 0.99).

Examples of projection LRPs derived from the aggregate abundance of each bin plotted against the proportion of year-trial combinations where all CUs were above their lower benchmark are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:example-projectedCurve). The choice of 200 fish bins was a trade-off between increasing smoothness of the curve with bins covering smaller range in aggregate abundances and computational limitations of small bins requiring a very large numbers of stochastic simulations to allow for a sufficient number of year-trial combinations within each bin to stabilize results. Also, for our case studies, 200 fish was within the range of uncertainty in observed spawner abundances.

Similar to logistic regression LRPs, the uncertainty in CU benchmarks and status are explicitly accounted for in projection LRPs when deriving the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs, there is no estimation uncertainty in projection LRPs because statistical model estimation is not required. Probabilities are derived directly from projections and underlying uncertainties are integrated directly into the overall probability. Therefore, confidence intervals are not provided. 

Also, similar to logistic regression based LRPs, structural uncertainty in underlying population dynamics can be considered through sensitivity analyses or model averaging by combining results from stochastic random trials across those structural assumptions. See our implementation for Interior Fraser Coho Salmon in Holt et al. (In review) for more details.

*Alignment with LRP Principles*

As for logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs use only one metric (annual spawner abundances), and therefore do not necessarily use the best available information (Principle 1) if CU statuses can be estimated using other metrics. Also similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs represent levels above serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated by status of any one CU being in the Red zone under the WSP, given the projection-based relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark. 

Also similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when harvest management occurs at the aggregate SMU level and requires an aggregate abundance LRP to inform decisions. However, this form of LRP may be more difficult to communicate being derived from projections under assumptions of equilibrium, and they require choosing the probability for all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, a choice that is difficult to justify on purely a scientific basis. <!--CH moved to CH6 of case study paper to simplify text here, and b/c showing the sensitivity to ER actually makes this methods more useful/operational, not less, at least according to Wilf. "Furthermore, projection LRPs are sensitive to exploitation rates, being higher under high exploitation rates and vice versa. Therefore an projection LRP developed under current exploitation cannot be used as a basis for evaluating alternative management procedures. However demonstrating the changes in aggregate abundances required for all CUs to be above lower benchmarks (i.e. changes in projection LRP) under different exploitation scenarios may help analysts and managers understand the implications of changing exploitation rates on the ability to achieve WSP objectives."--> Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the underlying parameter distributions and model structure capturing the plausible range of true underlying dynamics.<!--Reliability of LRP estimates depends on the reliability of underlying model parameters and structure. --> As with logistic regression LRPs, uncertainties can be propagated from CU-level benchmarks and status to LRPs (Principle 5). Unlike logistic regression LRPs though, this method can also integrate plausible ranges or future expectations of parameter and structural uncertainties that may differ from those observed historically. Similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are a reliable predictor of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU status on a single metric may deviate from the multidimensional approach recommended under the WSP. Similar to logistic regression-based LRPs, projection-based LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are able to reliably predict CU-level statuses.




<!-- OLD TEXT NOT NEEDED-->

<!-- CW: What exactly is this approach (below)? Just summing the lower benchmarks of all CUs? Or adding all the SR time series and estimating a single Sgen? Or something else? -->

<!--remove 
### Simple Aggregate Abundance LRPs
- There may be cases where SMU-level limit reference points may be based on analyses on the aggregate abundances, without defining finer spatial scales
= For example, for SMUs containing only one CU, LRP can be defined as the lower biological benchmark for the CU. 

- Although it may be possible to estimate LRPs based on aggregate data for SMUs that contains multiple CUs with very high covariance, in practice, natural variability in population dynamics among CUs within SMUs is generally high enough such that risks of CUS being depleted below lower benchmarks with this approach are not negligible (i.e., above acceptable levels). 
- This approach should only be considered in exceptional circumstances when there is evidence for high covariance in dynamics among CUs within and SMU and risks of individual CUs being depleted below lower benchmarks has been evaluated, e.g., through simulation evaluation. 

Evidence for covariation in CU-level dynamics can be derived from fisheries that are sampled for GSI, i.e., CU-proportions have not changed over time suggesting that smaller CUs are not being over harvested
- Also, available escapement data suggests CUs are stable,
- evidence of covariance in spawner time-series (or productivity time-series where available), >>0.5?


## Considerations When Selecting a LRP Estimation Method

- We propose a step-wise approach for identifying status relative to LRPs, which is based on the proportion of CUs status greater than red under the Wild Salmon Policy. 
- This LRP is recommended as the default for evaluating status under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act for Pacific Salmon, with additional aggregate-abundance based LRPs developed as required for local or international management and are supplemental.
- This stepwise approach is described in more detail in section \@ref(guidelines).
