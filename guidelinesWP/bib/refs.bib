A wide variety of estimation approaches have been developed, from simple to complex, and some worthwhile methodologies and auxiliary data are underutilized. The types and quality of the data available determine the most appropriate assessment methodology and the reliability of the assessment results. The management strategies available and the performance of these strategies are likewise highly dependent on the available data. This review gives an overview of the range of assessment methodologies, from the ad-hoc to hierarchical Bayesian state-space approaches. It emphasizes the central role of data; data types, data deficiencies, auxiliary information such as environmental indices, habitat characteristics, and similar stocks, and the effects of the data on the quality of guidance to managers.},

  abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is the process of using simulation testing with feedback to examine the robustness of candidate management strategies to error and uncertainty. The structure of the management strategy can be selected to attempt to satisfy desired (but conflicting) management objectives. MSE was used to assess the performance of the current management strategy and an alternative management strategy (the ``dynamic B0'' strategy) for the fishery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), when age-1 recruitment was driven by climate. The relationships between age-1 abundance and climate indices (and the uncertainties associated with these relationships) were characterized within an age-structured operating model that was fitted to the data for GOA walleye pollock. Projections into the future were based on the fitted relationships and predictions of those indices from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models, using the current or the alternative management strategy to determine catch limits. Management performance (the ability to leave the stock close to the management reference level and achieve high and stable catches) deteriorated when age-1 recruitment was forced by climate, although stocks were kept near the reference level on average. In addition, the ability to estimate management-related quantities, such as spawning biomass, deteriorated markedly when recruitment was forced by climate. Performance was sensitive to the choice of IPCC dataset and, in particular, estimation and management performance was poorest (outcomes most variable) for the IPCC datasets that led to the greatest variation in recruitment to the fishery. Although basing management on a ``dynamic B0'' management strategy led to improved management and estimation performance, the magnitude of the improvement was slight.},

  abstract = {Life history diversity of imperiled Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. substantially contributes to their persistence, and conservation of such diversity is a critical element of recovery efforts. Preserving and restoring diversity of life history traits depends in part on environmental factors affecting their expression. We analyzed relationships between annual hydrograph patterns and life history traits (spawn timing, age at spawning, age at outmigration, and body size) of Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to identify environmental indicators of current and historic diversity. Based on mean monthly flow patterns, we identified three hydrologic regimes: snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, and transitional. Chinook populations in snowmelt-dominated areas contained higher proportions of the stream-type life history (juvenile residence {$>$}1 year in freshwater), had older spawners, and tended to spawn earlier in the year than populations in rainfall-dominated areas. There are few extant Puget Sound populations dominated by the stream-type life history, as several populations with high proportions of stream-type fish have been extirpated by construction of dams that prevent migration into snowmelt-dominated reaches. The few extant populations are thus a high priority for conservation. The low level of genetic distinction between stream-type and ocean-type (juvenile residence {$<$}1 year in freshwater) life histories suggests that allowing some portion of extant populations to recolonize habitats above dams might allow re-expression of suppressed life history characteristics, creating a broader spatial distribution of the stream-type life history. Climate change ultimately may limit the effectiveness of some conservation efforts, as stream-type Chinook may be dependent on a diminishing snowmelt-dominated habitat.},

  abstract = {Reference points identify benchmarks, thresholds, or decision points for fisheries management, and are commonly defined by stock status indicators that presume equilibrium population conditions in the absence of fishing (e.g., equilibrium biomass, B0). However, equilibrium population biomass may be an inappropriate reference level when stock productivity is influenced by environmental change, predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem thresholds, and myriad other factors. Simulations were conducted to compare equilibrium-based (static B0) and non-equilibrium based (dynamic B0) indicators of stock status under alternative states of nature driven by time-varying recruitment dynamics (productivity regime), fishing dynamics (mortality regime), and species life history. Using dynamic B0 often implied a different state of the stock under directional productivity regime shifts, but was more similar to static B0 reference points under cyclic or white noise productivity scenarios. Uncertainty in stock status arising from incorrectly identifying changes in system productivity generally outweighed the uncertainty associated with initial equilibrium conditions. Empirical results across 18 U.S. West Coast groundfish stock assessments indicated predominantly small differences ({$<$} 10\%) between static B0 and dynamic B0 indicators of stock status, although in some cases differences were large (up to 72\%) or spanned reference points that trigger management action. Although caution is warranted when considering dynamic reference points, this paper shows these approaches are likely to be most useful when stock productivity shifts directionally, if that productivity signal can be correctly ascertained.},

We fit a rectilinear "hockey stick" model to 14 historical data sets of female spawner abundance and resulting smolt production and found that at low spawner abundance, the average productivity was about 85 smolts per female spawner. Variation in productivity among streams may be related to the quality of the stream habitat. We show how freshwater productivity can be combined with forecasts of marine survival to provide a limit reference point harvest rate. Our method will permit harvest rates to track changes in ocean productivity. We also used the historical data to estimate that, on average, a density of 19 female spawners{$\cdot$}km               -1               is required to fully seed freshwater habitats with juveniles. However, there was considerable variation among the streams that might limit the utility of this measure as a reference point. Uncertainty in the forecasts of marine survival and other parameters needs to be incorporated into our scheme before it can be considered a precautionary approach.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the scientific basis for the recovery objectives contained in the September 2004 draft recovery plans for Cultus and Sakinaw Lake sockeye salmon and Interior Fraser coho salmon. First, a brief review of recovery objectives for a variety of other North American salmonid recovery plans was conducted, and we concluded that the objectives of the 3 plans were consistent with current practice; the main difference was that the objectives were more quantitative than was usual in other jurisdictions. Next, objectives that were developed for purpose of conserving genetic resources in the endangered populations were compared to the recent literature and were found to be minimally adequate. In a review of population viability analysis (PVA) and its application to setting conservation targets, we concluded that demographically-based conservation goals in the order of 1,000 annual spawners was only adequate if there was an additional objective of maintaining positive population growth. We detailed and reviewed the evidence for depensatory mortality in Cultus Lake on juvenile sockeye salmon and concurred with the recovery team that there was reason to be concerned that at low spawner abundance reduced smolt production rates could inhibit recovery. Lastly, we documented the evidence used to develop a total escapement estimate for Interior Fraser coho salmon that would meet recovery objectives for individual populations and sub-populations. A comparison of the recovery objectives with recent historical abundances indicates that the recovery targets for the 3 salmon populations are all less than one third of recent maxima. Thus the teams have been consistent in interpreting recovery as an abundance at the lower range of the spectrum of values they might have considered, well below the carrying capacity of their habitats. We conclude that there is a need to develop plans to maintain population productivity to ensure persistence at the proposed recovery targets.}

Recovery measures that include a conservation breeding program, harvest management and a predator control program in Cultus Lake have been implemented. This report reviews the current status of the population and the efficacy of the recovery measures. We found that that status of the population has not improved since 2003 largely because of poor smolt-recruit survival, and the average number of spawners remains at about 1000 fish. Harvest rates have been reduced since the 1990s and the predator control program appears to have increased the survival of juveniles in the lake. Supplementation releases of juveniles from the captive breeding program to the lake have resulted in increasing numbers of returning hatchery adults, but their success as spawners in the wild remains unknown. Modelling suggests that under the current low smolt-recuit survival rates, recovery is only possible with the successful implementation of all recovery measures. We conclude that the recovery of the Cultus Lake sockeye salmon population is highly uncertain and that continued monitoring is needed to determine if the recovery actions are indeed reducing risks to the population}

Non-displacement rearing occurs if juveniles originating from the same drainage as the hatchery are released back into the natal stream. Displacement rearing occurs if part of the rearing and release strategy occurs at a foreign drainage or includes the marine environment. We compared straying between non-displacement and three types of displacement releases where: (1) juveniles are transported, reared in a central hatchery and released back into natal drainage (satellite); (2) or transported, reared in a central or recipient hatchery and released in a foreign drainage (transplant); (3) or reared and released directly into the marine environment away from the home drainage (out-estuary). Compared with non-displacement rearing, displacement-reared \textregistered sh were between two and \textregistered ve times more likely to stray (2.1{$\pm$}5.3\% vs 1.2\%). Out-estuary releases had the highest stray rates of the displacement rearing types and were suspected of being least successful at imprinting on the home stream. Analysis of hybrid and transplanted stocks suggested that there was a genetic component to homing. A hybrid stock was three times more likely to stray than the natal stock released at the same time and location (6.2\% vs 2.4\%). Transplanted \textregistered sh without exposure to their ancestral drainage were more likely to stray back to the ancestral drainage than non-transplanted \textregistered sh released at the same time and location (2.9\% vs 0.1\%). Approximately 50\% of the stray migrants were recovered within 30 km of the release site, indicating that the highest risk of straying may occur during the transition from bi-coordinate navigation to imprinted natal stream clues. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) are an important forage fish for many predators, and they also support the largest commercial fishery by weight on the U.S. East Coast. Menhaden management has been working toward ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden's role in the ecosystem. The goal of this work was to develop menhaden ERPs using ecosystem models. An existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf (NWACS) was reduced in complexity from 61 to 17 species/functional groups. The new NWACS model of intermediate complexity for ecosystems (NWACS-MICE) serves to link the dynamics of menhaden with key managed predators. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were determined to be most sensitive to menhaden harvest and therefore served as an indicator of ecosystem impacts. ERPs were based on the tradeoff relationship between the equilibrium biomass of striped bass and menhaden fishing mortality (F). The ERPs were defined as the menhaden F rates that maintain striped bass at their biomass target and threshold when striped bass are fished at their Ftarget, and all other modeled species were fished at status quo levels. These correspond to an ERP Ftarget of 0.19 and an ERP Fthreshold of 0.57, which are lower than the single species reference points by 30\textendash 40\%, but higher than current (2017) menhaden F. The ERPs were then fed back into the agestructured stock assessment model projections to provide information on total allowable catch. The ERPs developed in this study were adopted by the Atlantic menhaden Management Board, marking a shift toward ecosystem-based fishery management for this economically and ecologically important species.},

It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

The model is a natural extension of traditional models, which only incorporate the negative effects of increasing density on fecundity and (or) survival. Because the new model is intrinsically nonlinear and because of convergence problems at local optima, we use a maximum likelihood approach with a global genetic search algorithm to estimate model parameters. Parameter uncertainty is obtained from the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Based on this new model, an extinction probability curve is developed using the parameter defining the Allee effects. This curve can readily be used to calculate the theoretical probability of extinction for a single brood line in one generation for any particular spawner number or biomass. Alternatively, because managers may wish to assign reference points corresponding to particular extinction probabilities, spawner numbers can be determined for these reference points. Two Pacific salmon populations, North Thompson coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chilko sockeye (O. nerka), are used to demonstrate the approach. It is found that the Allee effect parameter is statistically significant for the Thompson coho, but not for Chilko sockeye.},

Hatchery fish with multiple generations of hatchery ancestry often have heritably lower reproductive success than wild fish and may reduce the fitness of an entire population. Whether this reduced fitness also occurs for hatchery fish created with local- and predominantly wild-origin parents remains controversial. Here, we review recent studies on the reproductive success of such `early-generation' hatchery fish that spawn in the wild. Combining 51 estimates from six studies on four salmon species, we found that (i) early-generation hatchery fish averaged only half the reproductive success of their wild-origin counterparts when spawning in the wild, (ii) the reduction in reproductive success was more severe for males than for females, and (iii) all species showed reduced fitness due to hatchery rearing. We review commonalities among studies that point to possible mechanisms (e.g., environmental versus genetic effects). Furthermore, we illustrate that sample sizes typical of these studies result in low statistical power to detect fitness differences unless the differences are substantial. This review demonstrates that reduced fitness of early-generation hatchery fish may be a general phenomenon. Future research should focus on determining the causes of those fitness reductions and whether they lead to long-term reductions in the fitness of wild populations.},

Our main results highlight: (i) that biomass-linked harvest control rules (HCRs) can partially compensate for changing production, even if the HCR is time invariant; and (ii) that the form of utility (e.g. risk neutral or risk averse) can result in remarkably different optimal decision paths. Performance over future horizons degrades marginally from dynamic HCRs to static HCRs (except at low productivity where differences are more pronounced) but markedly when the biomass level is ignored altogether, as is the case in many managed fish populations globally. Understanding the processes whereby climate affects productivity is important for interpreting past data, but forecasts are not needed for tactical decision making now. Instead, we argue that the priorities for managing fish stocks influenced by climate change are to: measure the current productivity, assess the current abundance of the stock, and respond with a dynamic HCR.},

  abstract = {Pacific salmon productivity is influenced by ocean conditions and interspecific interactions, yet their combined effects are poorly understood. Using data from 47 North American sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations, we present evidence that the magnitude and direction of climate and competition effects vary over large spatial scales. In the south, a warm ocean and abundant salmon competitors combined to strongly reduce sockeye productivity, whereas in the north, a warm ocean substantially increased productivity and offset the negative effects of competition at sea. From 2005 to 2015, the approximately 82 million adult pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) produced annually from hatcheries were estimated to have reduced the productivity of southern sockeye salmon by ϳ15\%, on average. In contrast, for sockeye at the northwestern end of their range, the same level of hatchery production was predicted to have reduced the positive effects of a warming ocean by ϳ50\% (from a ϳ10\% to a ϳ5\% increase in productivity, on average). These findings reveal spatially dependent effects of climate and competition on sockeye productivity and highlight the need for international discussions about large-scale hatchery production.},

Despite ample evidence of density-dependent selection, the influence of prey density on predatory selection patterns has seldom been investigated empirically. We used 20 years of field data on brown bears (Ursus arctos) foraging on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Alaska, to test the hypothesis that salmon density affects the strength of sizeselective predation. Measurements from 41,240 individual salmon were used to calculate variance-standardized selection differentials describing the direction and magnitude of selection. Across the time series, the intensity of predatory selection was inversely correlated with salmon density; greater selection for smaller salmon occurred at low salmon densities as bears' tendency to kill larger-than-average salmon was magnified. This novel connection between density dependence and selective predation runs contrary to some aspects of optimal foraging theory and differs from many observations of density-dependent selection because (1) the direction of selection remains constant while its magnitude changes as a function of density and (2) stronger selection is observed at low abundance. These findings indicate that sockeye salmon may be subject to fishery-induced size selection from both direct mechanisms and latent effects of altered predatory selection patterns on the spawning grounds, resulting from reduced salmon abundance.},

A longitudinal study design that accounted for correlation among individuals revealed growth at all ages was reduced when the biomass of North American chum, sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) was high. When North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) was positive, indicating increased primary productivity, predicted growth increased. Climate variation influenced competition effects. For instance, density-dependent competition effects increased when NPGO became more positive and Pacific Decadal Oscillation became more negative (indicating cool conditions), causing the greatest range in predicted scale size. Chum salmon are likely to exhibit continued reduction in growth at age due to increased ocean temperatures driven by climate change and high aggregate salmon biomass that includes hatchery releases. If evidence of biomass and climate effects presented here are common among Pacific salmon populations, reduction of hatchery releases should be considered.},

  abstract = {Fishery managers often rely on forecasts of future population abundance to set allowable harvest quotas or exploitation rates. While there has been substantial research devoted to identifying environmental factors that can predict recruitment for individual populations, such correlations often degrade over time, thereby limiting their utility for management. Conversely, examining multiple populations at once to detect shared, spatially structured patterns can offer insights into their recruitment dynamics that are advantageous for forecasting. Here, we develop a population dynamics model for natural origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) stocks in Washington State that leverages spatial and temporal autocorrelation in marine survival to improve one-yearahead forecasts of adult returns. Executed in a Bayesian hierarchical integrated modelling framework, our spatiotemporal approach incorporates multiple data types and shares information among stocks to estimate key biological parameters that are informative for forecasting. Retrospective evaluation of one-year-ahead forecast skill indicated that the spatiotemporal integrated population model (ST-IPM) outperformed existing forecasts of Washington State coho salmon returns by 25\textendash 38 \% on average. Moreover, the ST-IPM estimates parameters that were previously non-identifiable for many stocks, and propagates uncertainty from multiple contributing data sources into model forecasts. Our results add to a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of spatio\- temporal and integrated approaches for modelling population dynamics, and the framework developed here has broad applications to the assessment and management of coho salmon in Washington State and elsewhere throughout their range.},

We used dynamic factor analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

In exploited systems, however, management goals to preserve diversity may be in tension with harvest objectives. For example, fisheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of fisheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a Pacific salmon stock aggregate and its fishery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries influences management performance. We focused on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon fisheries. Additionally, we examined how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock fisheries may change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We found that increasing single-stock fishery allocations increased aggregate abundance and improved the status of some stocks relative to their conservation benchmarks. However, these improvements did not occur uniformly\textendash relatively abundant, productive stocks exhibited no change, or even declines, in conservation performance as single-stock fishery allocations increased. Furthermore, differences in performance between mixed- and single-stock fisheries were reduced when productivity was uniformly low, when the mixedstock fishery was managed conservatively, or when mortality during freshwater migrations was high. While single-stock fisheries can increase the probability that conservation-based objectives will be met, they are not a panacea and may only be effective when specific conditions are met.},

  abstract = {Status assessments for Chum Salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) have been limited, in part because recruitment time-series required to calculate stock- recruitment based benchmarks are not consistently available. Alternative benchmarks have been proposed for data-limited Conservation Units (CUs) using percentiles of the observed spawner abundance time-series. However, these benchmarks have not been evaluated against stock-recruitment benchmarks currently used to assess status on abundances for data-rich CUs. Our goals were to evaluate percentile-based benchmarks against stock-recruitment based benchmarks accounting for high uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates, and age-at-maturity. We used two approaches to evaluate benchmarks based on a retrospective comparison through the historical record and a prospective simulation model under numerous hypothetical future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach for providing assessments that accounts for uncertainties in benchmarks, and provide advice on the applicability of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon relative to stock-recruitment benchmarks used for data-rich CUs. In general, our results support the application of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high ({$>$}2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate ({$\leq$}40\%). However, we suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks (and the consideration of alternatives) when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. Under these conditions, concurrent declines in abundances and percentile benchmarks can results in status assessments that are more optimistic than those from stock-recruitment benchmarks due to shifting baselines.},

  abstract = {Canada's Wild Salmon Policy requires that quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics that delineate Red, Amber, and Green zones of status be established for all Conservation Units. Although candidate benchmarks have been identified from the scientific literature and previous management experience, they have not been evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the goals of the Wild Salmon Policy. Using a simulation model, we evaluated lower benchmarks on two classes of indicators (abundances and fishing mortality relative to productivity) on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. This technical document provides the methodology and results for those analyses and is a companion document to the overall synthesis paper "Indicators of Status and Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada's Wild Salmon Policy" (Holt et al. 2009). We considered the "worst-case" management scenario, with management decisions corresponding to CUs being depleted to the lower benchmark each year. Although unrealistic, this assumption provides an upper limit on the probability of extirpation and lower limit on the probability of recovery. We found that for metrics of spawner abundances, the lower benchmark, spawner abundance that will result in recovery to SMSY (spawner abundance at maximum sustained yield) in one generation under equilibrium conditions (Sgen), was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {$<$}25\%) over 100 years (for populations with equilibrium abundances {$>$} 15 000 spawners) and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {$>$}75\%) when uncertainties in all major components of the fishery system were accounted for. Furthermore, the probability of extirpation for Sgen was more robust to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY. For metrics of fishing mortality, the lower benchmark FMSY (fishing mortality at maximum sustained yield) was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {$<$}25\%) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances {$>$} 30 000 spawners, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {$>$}75\%), and its performance was more robust to variability in stock productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature. Based on those results and a risk classification scheme developed in DFO's Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009), we suggest deriving lower benchmarks on spawner abundances from Sgen and lower benchmarks on fishing mortality from FMSY. Further work will be required to identify specific risk tolerances of stakeholders in order to better inform the choice of lower benchmarks.},

  abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the ``best'' model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

  abstract = {The recovery of depleted species depends on their population dynamics at low abundance. Classical population growth models, applied widely in fisheries science, assume that per capita offspring production increases as abundance declines (compensation). However, slow or absent recovery by many depleted fishes might reflect unexpectedly weak compensation or the presence of Allee effects (depensation). Using meta-analytical techniques to describe reproductive dynamics, we find considerable variability among 207 exploited marine fish stocks (104 species) in how standardized per capita population growth changes with abundance. Although many species exhibit strong compensatory dynamics (negative density dependence), others show much weaker compensation than expected, and some exhibit evidence of an Allee effect, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Alaskan walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). As data at low levels of abundance become increasingly available, it appears that compensation, while strong in some species, is comparatively weak or nonexistent in others, thus providing an explanation for why the recovery of some depleted stocks, despite reductions in exploitation, has been considerably less than what classic models of population growth would otherwise suggest.},

  abstract = {A thrust toward fisheries co-management systems occurred globally throughout the 1990s. This was partially influenced by the collapse of groundfish stocks including the iconic northern cod and other fisheries resources in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). The management system for NL snow crab burgeoned during this period, largely in the absence of biological information for the resource. There is a high volume of theoretical literature advocating for the benefits of fisheries co-management, but little documented perspectives from fisheries scientists actively engaged in such management systems, nor literature detailing how co-management regimes could affect scientific research or assessment programs. In this paper, in context of a large fishery, we provide specific examples of how co-management processes can influence scientific research and monitoring programs and the biological functioning of important marine resources. We undertake critical evaluation on topics including spatial scales of management, fishery timing, fishery closures, collaborative research, and harvester perceptions of stock size. We conclude there are both scientific advantages and disadvantages to operating within co-management systems, but that the NL snow crab management system has evolved to promote processes problematic to provision of the best possible science advice. We conclude that adaptive co-management measures are required to address several current challenges in order to maximize scientific value within this system. In general, the paper demonstrates how flexibility is needed by all partners involved in resource comanagement systems to adapt to fundamental scientific principles inherent in changing methodologies and the generation of knowledge.},

There are multiple ways to calculate BRPs when biological parameters are time varying. Using summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a case study, we investigated time-varying approaches in concert with climate-linked population models to understand the impact of environmentally driven variability in natural mortality, recruitment, and size-at-age on two commonly used BRPs {$\frac{1}{2}$}B0\dh t\TH{} and F35\%(t)]. We used the following two approaches to calculate time-varying BRPs: dynamic-BRP and moving-average-BRP. We quantified the variability and uncertainty of different climate dependencies and estimation approaches, attributed BRP variation to variation in life-history processes, and evaluated how using different approaches impacts estimates of stock status. Results indicate that the dynamic-BRP approach using the climate-linked natural mortality model produced the least variable reference points compared to others calculated. Summer flounder stock status depended on the estimation approach and climate model used. These results emphasize that understanding climate dependencies is important for summer flounder reference points and perhaps other species, and careful consideration is warranted when considering what time-varying approach to use, ideally based upon simulation studies within a proposed set of management procedures.},

Unfortunately the data typically needed to establish these `goals', using stock-recruitment techniques, are expensive to gather and are, for most stocks, lacking. This prompted us to develop the habitat-based approach to generate escapement goals described in this report. We related productive capacity to freshwater habitat area based on results from a meta-analysis of 25 Chinook stocks. Stocks were distributed between central Alaska and northern Oregon and represented a broad range of environments and life history. We developed an allometric model that predicted Smsy and Srep (spawners required to produced maximum sustained yield and replacement, respectively) from the watershed area and assessed the model's performance. The model adequately predicted the Smsy and Srep for an independent data source and out-performed a current interim method applied to British Columbia (BC) Key Streams. The habitat-based approach adequately predicted Smsy and Srep for seven case study examples, although it overestimated the productive capacity of stocks with relatively small spawning areas. Our habitat-based model can generate biologically-based escapement goals, rooted in fish-production relationships, for data limited stocks over a broad range of environments. This simple approach requires easily acquirable data and makes few assumptions. However, spawner escapements of known accuracy and reliability are required, which may impede implementation for some systems. The approach is well-suited for most data limited stocks in BC and can be tested and refined as new stock-recruitment data become available. Since the habitat-based method was more accurate than the interim method for BC Key Streams, we recommend applying it for data limited stocks in BC to establish escapement goals until more stock-specific data are available.}

We describe a bootstrap procedure that follows the trapezoidal AUC method and incorporates the uncertainty associated with fish counts, the shape of the spawner curve, observer efficiency, and residence time. However, the procedure does not incorporate all sources of uncertainty or address the problems posed by sparse surveys or nonzero first or last counts. For the peak count method, the procedure was modified to include the uncertainty from fish counts, observer efficiency, the expansion factor, and the timing of scheduled flights with respect to peak spawning activity. Data from spring-run, stream-type chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Nicola River, British Columbia, were used to demonstrate the procedures' applications. Replicate aerial spawner counts were similar and repeatable, and annual residence times were consistent over 4 years. The AUC escapement estimates were precise, reliable, and accurate when compared with independent mark\textendash recapture escapement estimates, whereas the peak count escapement estimates were precise but less reliable and accurate. We expect that AUC escapement estimates calculated from the mean residence time of 4 years will be less biased (Ϫ8\% to ϩ5\%) than peak count estimates from the mean expansion factor of 4 years (Ϫ14\% to ϩ21\%). The procedures that we describe for incorporating uncertainty into AUC and peak count escapement estimation should enable fisheries biologists to more adequately assess changes in abundance and stock status.},

However, the data required to quantify status are often limited, and it is important to understand how assessments of status may be biased by assumptions in data analysis. For Pacific salmon, biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and spawner\textendash recruitment (SR) analyses often involve ``run reconstructions'' that impute missing spawner data, expand observed spawner abundance to account for unmonitored streams, assign catch to individual stocks, and quantify age-at-return. Using a stochastic simulation approach, we quantified how common assumptions in run reconstructions biased assessments of biological status based on spawner abundance. We found that status assessments were robust to most common assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase rates of status misclassification. Our results lend confidence to biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and SR analyses, even in the face of incomplete data.},

We evaluated three metrics of spawning distribution and four sampling designs for their ability to detect simulated contractions in the production of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). We simulated population dynamics at 100 sites using a spawner\textendash recruit model that incorporated natural variability in recruitment, age-at-maturity, dispersal, and measurement error in observations of abundance. Sensitivity analyses revealed that high observation error and straying of spawners from their natal streams may mask changes in distribution. Furthermore, monitoring only sites with high spawner abundance, as is often practiced, failed to capture the simulated contraction of production, emphasizing the importance of matching monitoring programs with assessment objectives.},

This indicates that important environmental processes affecting variation in sockeye survival rate from spawners to recruits operate at regional spatial scales, rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. The observed covariation in survival rates of Bristol Bay stocks appears to be due to a combination of both freshwater and, to a greater degree, marine processes. Bristol Bay sockeye stocks showed a dramatic and persistent increase in survival rates coinciding with the abrupt changes in the North Pacific environment in the mid-1970s; however, there was little evidence of a similar response for Fraser River stocks.},

There are several reasons to adopt limit reference points, and jurisdictions without previously defined limit reference points could adopt them in order to align better with the Magnuson\textendash Stevens Act (American fisheries) or, more importantly, to facilitate cross-jurisdiction sustainability assessments, which are increasingly needed for certifications of sustainability. In actual practice, the stock size of 0.5 times a target reference point has been used as a limit reference point for some Pacific salmon fisheries, or at least as a proxy for a limit reference point. We term this point the ``minimum stock size threshold,'' following a convention already in use, and we note that limit reference points defined this way are increasingly being accepted as a standard either because of justification based on simulation and fishery principles or for purely pragmatic reasons.},

  abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the `well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the `Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

Management strategies can be modified to use environmental data using the ``dynamic B0'' concept, and changing the set of years used to define biomass reference points. Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The ``mechanistic approach'' estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the fished species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the ``empirical approach'' examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known. As such, until the skill of stock projection models improves, it seems more appropriate to consider the implications of plausible broad forecasts related to how biological parameters may change in the future as a way to assess the robustness of management strategies, rather than attempting specific predictions per se.},

We found strong evidence of positive covariation among spawner-to-recruit survival rates of wild stocks within regions and between certain adjacent regions (e.g., correlations from 0.3 to 0.7) but little evidence of covariation between stocks of distant regions (e.g., separated by 1,000 km or more). Similarly, for hatchery stocks from Washington, British Columbia, and southeast Alaska, positive covariation in the indices of fry-to-recruit survival rate occurred only within regions and between certain adjacent regions. These patterns suggest that important environmental processes affecting interannual variation in spawner-to-recruit survival rates of chum salmon operate at local or regional spatial scales rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. These results are similar to our previous findings for sockeye salmon O. nerka and pink salmon O. gorbuscha and help identify the spatial characteristics of environmental variables required to improve forecasting models and better understand the effects of climatic changes on salmon productivity. Our finding that local or regional-scale processes primarily affect productivity differs from that of other studies, which suggest that large, ocean-basin-scale processes predominate. However, the latter studies were mostly based on time series of aggregate catch data, which provide limited spatial resolution and are potentially confounded by several factors.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to ``bridge'' Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi'kmaw) embraces ``learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,'' as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative\textemdash central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

Model averaging and ensemble methods were used to combine the results of converged models for each species. Model averaging was based on both predictive (i.e., cross-validation, AIC) and retrospective performance metrics. Models allowing large shifts in M provided the best fit to observed data for both species and were also regarded as the most plausible. For Atlantic Cod, variance in biomass estimates among the individual models was very high and multimodel estimates were sensitive to the relative weight given to competing models. In contrast, converged Yellowtail Flounder models produced broadly similar output and multimodel estimates were more robust to model weights. Our results suggest that the plausibility of competing models should be scrutinized, particularly when structural uncertainty is high.},

  abstract = {This report summarizes progress to date on the development of reference points for the management of various marine invertebrate species commercially harvested in Canada. The implementation of the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada requires the definition of reference points reflecting the productivity and reproductive capacity of a stock. The different invertebrate species commonly fished in Canada exhibit a very diverse range of life history characteristics. For these species, reproductive success will be a function of life history factors such as effective female fecundity, spawning opportunities for females, spatial patterns of age\textendash size structure, the relationship between spawner density and fertilization success \textemdash{} especially for broadcast spawners with sedentary or sessile adults, spatial and temporal aspects of breeding areas, and the relationship between benthic settlement success and habitat suitability. For many species the time period between spawning and actually being able to observe recruits may be long enough so that cumulative environmental influences on survival could radically reduce year-class strength. Also, there is often a mismatch between managed areas and stock area so that recruitment success in one area may be affected by spawning success in another area. The lack of adequate models to account for these complexities has often resulted in the use of empirical methods to define the type of reference points expected by the DFO PA policy. To date, empirical methods have used either an estimate of or an indicator of population biomass or abundance to represent the productivity of the stock. Given that biomass alone is an incomplete measure of productivity, many invertebrate stock assessments rely on secondary indicators such as population size, composition-based and sex ratio-based growth changes, spawner abundance or biomass, abundance of prerecruits, predator abundance, environmental changes and spatial patterns of density, to modify stock status advice. For many sedentary species (e.g., bivalves and echinoderms), primarily spatially-based limits and targets for fisheries may be more appropriate. However, methods for spatial approaches still need to be developed.},

Thus, assessment models assuming stationary reproductive output may inaccurately estimate biological reference points that inform harvest policies. We extended age-structured state-space spawner\textendash recruit models to accommodate demographic time trends and fishery selectivity to investigate temporal changes in reference points using Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We illustrate that observed demographic changes have likely reduced per capita reproductive output in an additive manner, for example, models including changes in both length-at-age and age composition showed larger declines than models incorporating only one time trend. Translated into biological reference points using a yield-per-recruit algorithm, we found escapement needed for maximum sustained catch has likely increased over time, but the magnitude further depended on size-selective harvest (i.e., larger increases for reference points based on larger mesh gillnets). Compared to traditional salmon assessments, our approach that acknowledges demographic time trends allows more complete use of available data and facilitates evaluating trade-offs among gear-specific harvest policies.},

A changing climate will likely have differing effects on different species; some will flourish, some will flounder. Management targets for fishing mortality and spawning biomass are often calculated by assuming stationary population processes, but under climate change, this assumption may be violated. Non-stationary population processes can introduce bias into estimates of biomass from stock assessments and calculations of target fishing mortalities and biomasses. However, few accepted frameworks exist for incorporating the changing influence of the environment on exploited populations into management strategies. Identifying changes in population processes due to environmental influences is important in order to enable climate-enhanced management strategy evaluations to elucidate the potential benefits and costs of changing management targets. Cost/benefit analyses will also be useful when coincidentally caught species respond differently to environmental change.},

Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and largemagnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and FMSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of BMSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between fishing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overfishing by going beyond FMSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable fisheries.},
