	abstract = {Conservation scientists rarely have the information required to understand changes in abundance over more than a few decades, even for important species like Pacific salmon. Such lack of historical information can underestimate the magnitude of decline for depressed populations. We applied genetic tools to a unique collection of 100-year-old salmon scales to reveal declines of 56\%–99\% in wild sockeye populations across Canada’s second largest salmon watershed, the Skeena River. These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

Modern ecological data typically neglect past magnitudes of change, which fortunately can be evaluated by bridging disparate knowledge sources. We synthesized zooarchaeological, historical, traditional, and western science knowledge to document changes in relative abundance of key species in Canada's northern abalone social–ecological system (SES) from the Holocene to present. Integrated models ﬁt to traditional and western science data revealed 3.7\% annual population decline from 1940s to 2010s for large abalone, although traditional knowledge density estimates were 9.5× higher than those derived from western science. Abalone are presently scarce compared to the mid-1900s, but more abundant than before the early 1800s, calling their endangered status into question. Linking multiple knowledge sources can build SES understanding, facilitate power sharing, and support ecologically sustainable and socially just conservation outcomes.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to “bridge” Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw) embraces “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,” as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative—central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

	abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

	abstract = {Thirty-nine years of scale growth measurements from Big Qualicum River chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in southern British Columbia demonstrated that competition and climate variation affect marine growth and age-at-maturity. A longitudinal study design that accounted for correlation among individuals revealed growth at all ages was reduced when the biomass of North American chum, sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) was high. When North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) was positive, indicating increased primary productivity, predicted growth increased. Climate variation inﬂuenced competition effects. For instance, density-dependent competition effects increased when NPGO became more positive and Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation became more negative (indicating cool conditions), causing the greatest range in predicted scale size. Chum salmon are likely to exhibit continued reduction in growth at age due to increased ocean temperatures driven by climate change and high aggregate salmon biomass that includes hatchery releases. If evidence of biomass and climate effects presented here are common among Paciﬁc salmon populations, reduction of hatchery releases should be considered.},

	abstract = {The document was prepared in support of an advisory process meeting to produce a technical guidance document to assist science practitioners responsible for developing the science elements of the Precautionary Approach (PA) framework. It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used dynamic factor analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Paciﬁc Current as it reaches North America’s west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Paciﬁc salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Stock–recruitment relationships (SRRs) may vary over time due to ecological and anthropogenic impacts, challenging traditional approaches of calculating maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-based reference points that assume constant population traits. We compare seven methods to calculate MSY, FMSY and BMSY by modelling constant, stochastic (uncorrelated), and autocorrelated SRRs using simulations and two case studies [Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada]. Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and largemagnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and FMSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of BMSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between ﬁshing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overﬁshing by going beyond FMSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable ﬁsheries.},

This chapter focuses on the complexity of proper management of the commons, specifically, policies to control total allowable catch (TAC) and total harvesting capacity: what are the major challenges, why is it easy for policy makers to misperceive, and how can communication be improved to ensure more rapid learning? Section 45.2 deals with the problem of overcapacity and resource depletion in the process of adapting fishing industries to resource limits. Section 45.3 considers " steady-state " strategies for controlling TAC and total capacity in fisheries with environmental variation. Section 45.4 deals with implications of assessment error for steady-state policies. Finally, section 45.5 discusses boundaries of models and methods and calls for balanced interdisciplinary analysis, and section 45.6 concludes.},

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

In many Paciﬁc salmon Oncorhynchus spp. ﬁshery jurisdictions, management only uses “target reference points”—the speciﬁc numerical management objective intended to bring about some ﬁshery beneﬁt. There are several reasons to adopt limit reference points, and jurisdictions without previously deﬁned limit reference points could adopt them in order to align better with the Magnuson–Stevens Act (American ﬁsheries) or, more importantly, to facilitate cross-jurisdiction sustainability assessments, which are increasingly needed for certiﬁcations of sustainability. In actual practice, the stock size of 0.5 times a target reference point has been used as a limit reference point for some Paciﬁc salmon ﬁsheries, or at least as a proxy for a limit reference point. We term this point the “minimum stock size threshold,” following a convention already in use, and we note that limit reference points deﬁned this way are increasingly being accepted as a standard either because of justiﬁcation based on simulation and ﬁshery principles or for purely pragmatic reasons.},

	abstract = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada requires escapement goals for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks to evaluate their status and achieve objectives established by international agreements and domestic policy. Unfortunately the data typically needed to establish these ‘goals’, using stock-recruitment techniques, are expensive to gather and are, for most stocks, lacking. This prompted us to develop the habitat-based approach to generate escapement goals described in this report.

We related productive capacity to freshwater habitat area based on results from a meta-analysis of 25 Chinook stocks. Stocks were distributed between central Alaska and northern Oregon and represented a broad range of environments and life history. We developed an allometric model that predicted Smsy and Srep (spawners required to produced maximum sustained yield and replacement, respectively) from the watershed area and assessed the model’s performance. The model adequately predicted the Smsy and Srep for an independent data source and out-performed a current interim method applied to British Columbia (BC) Key Streams. The habitat-based approach adequately predicted Smsy and Srep for seven case study examples, although it overestimated the productive capacity of stocks with relatively small spawning areas.

Our habitat-based model can generate biologically-based escapement goals, rooted in fish-production relationships, for data limited stocks over a broad range of environments. This simple approach requires easily acquirable data and makes few assumptions. However, spawner escapements of known accuracy and reliability are required, which may impede implementation for some systems. The approach is well-suited for most data limited stocks in BC and can be tested and refined as new stock-recruitment data become available. Since the habitat-based method was more accurate than the interim method for BC Key Streams, we recommend applying it for data limited stocks in BC to establish escapement goals until more stock-specific data are available.},

	abstract = {The sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) population from Cultus Lake, British Columbia, was assessed as endangered in 2003 as a result of a long term decline in abundance that began in the 1970s. Recovery measures that include a conservation breeding program, harvest management and a predator control program in Cultus Lake have been implemented. This report reviews the current status of the population and the efficacy of the recovery measures. We found that that status of the population has not improved since 2003 largely because of poor smolt-recruit survival, and the average number of spawners remains at about 1000 fish. Harvest rates have been reduced since the 1990s and the predator control program appears to have increased the survival of juveniles in the lake. Supplementation releases of juveniles from the captive breeding program to the lake have resulted in increasing numbers of returning hatchery adults, but their success as spawners in the wild remains unknown. Modelling suggests that under the current low smolt-recuit survival rates, recovery is only possible with the successful implementation of all recovery measures. We conclude that the recovery of the Cultus Lake sockeye salmon population is highly uncertain and that continued monitoring is needed to determine if the recovery actions are indeed reducing risks to the population},

We show how freshwater productivity can be combined with forecasts of marine survival to provide a limit reference point harvest rate.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the scientific basis for the recovery objectives contained in the September 2004 draft recovery plans for Cultus and Sakinaw Lake sockeye salmon and Interior Fraser coho salmon. First, a brief review of recovery objectives for a variety of other North American salmonid recovery plans was conducted, and we concluded that the objectives of the 3 plans were consistent with current practice; the main difference was that the objectives were more quantitative than was usual in other jurisdictions. Next, objectives that were developed for purpose of conserving genetic resources in the endangered populations were compared to the recent literature and were found to be minimally adequate. In a review of population viability analysis (PVA) and its application to setting conservation targets, we concluded that demographically-based conservation goals in the order of 1,000 annual spawners was only adequate if there was an additional objective of maintaining positive population growth. We detailed and reviewed the evidence for depensatory mortality in Cultus Lake on juvenile sockeye salmon and concurred with the recovery team that there was reason to be concerned that at low spawner abundance reduced smolt production rates could inhibit recovery. Lastly, we documented the evidence used to develop a total escapement estimate for Interior Fraser coho salmon that would meet recovery objectives for individual populations and sub-populations.

A comparison of the recovery objectives with recent historical abundances indicates that the recovery targets for the 3 salmon populations are all less than one third of recent maxima. Thus the teams have been consistent in interpreting recovery as an abundance at the lower range of the spectrum of values they might have considered, well below the carrying capacity of their habitats. We conclude that there is a need to develop plans to maintain population productivity to ensure persistence at the proposed recovery targets.},

	abstract = {A new type of stock–recruitment model is examined that incorporates Allee effects, which may occur when fish populations are small. The model is a natural extension of traditional models, which only incorporate the negative effects of increasing density on fecundity and (or) survival. Because the new model is intrinsically nonlinear and because of convergence problems at local optima, we use a maximum likelihood approach with a global genetic search algorithm to estimate model parameters. Parameter uncertainty is obtained from the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Based on this new model, an extinction probability curve is developed using the parameter defining the Allee effects. This curve can readily be used to calculate the theoretical probability of extinction for a single brood line in one generation for any particular spawner number or biomass. Alternatively, because managers may wish to assign reference points corresponding to particular extinction probabilities, spawner numbers can be determined for these reference points. Two Pacific salmon populations, North Thompson coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chilko sockeye (O. nerka), are used to demonstrate the approach. It is found that the Allee effect parameter is statistically significant for the Thompson coho, but not for Chilko sockeye.},

	abstract = {Canada's Wild Salmon Policy requires that quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics that delineate Red, Amber, and Green zones of status be established for all Conservation Units. Although candidate benchmarks have been identified from the scientific literature and previous management experience, they have not been evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the goals of the Wild Salmon Policy. Using a simulation model, we evaluated lower benchmarks on two classes of indicators (abundances and fishing mortality relative to productivity) on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. This technical document provides the methodology and results for those analyses and is a companion document to the overall synthesis paper "Indicators of Status and Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada's Wild Salmon Policy" (Holt et al. 2009). We considered the "worst-case" management scenario, with management decisions corresponding to CUs being depleted to the lower benchmark each year. Although unrealistic, this assumption provides an upper limit on the probability of extirpation and lower limit on the probability of recovery. We found that for metrics of spawner abundances, the lower benchmark, spawner abundance that will result in recovery to SMSY (spawner abundance at maximum sustained yield) in one generation under equilibrium conditions (Sgen), was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {\textless}25\%) over 100 years (for populations with equilibrium abundances {\textgreater} 15 000 spawners) and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {\textgreater}75\%) when uncertainties in all major components of the fishery system were accounted for. Furthermore, the probability of extirpation for Sgen was more robust to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY. For metrics of fishing mortality, the lower benchmark FMSY (fishing mortality at maximum sustained yield) was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {\textless}25\%) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances {\textgreater} 30 000 spawners, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {\textgreater}75\%), and its performance was more robust to variability in stock productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature. Based on those results and a risk classification scheme developed in DFO's Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009), we suggest deriving lower benchmarks on spawner abundances from Sgen and lower benchmarks on fishing mortality from FMSY. Further work will be required to identify specific risk tolerances of stakeholders in order to better inform the choice of lower benchmarks.},

Will depleted populations of Pacific salmon recover under persistent reductions in survival and catastrophic mortality events? – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 2018–2026. Under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, benchmarks between zones of biological status are required to distinguish populations requiring conservation attention (Red and Amber zones) from those that can be managed for production (Green zone). The recovery of depleted populations (i.e. from Red to Green) will depend in part on the choice of the lower benchmark. At a minimum, that benchmark should be set high enough to allow recovery within an acceptable time-frame in the absence of targeted fishing. Currently, benchmarks are evaluated and selected using simulation models that assess the probability of recovery to spawner abundance associated with the maximum sustainable yield within a specified time-frame. Guided by case examples, the evaluation is extended to include two scenarios of future conditions: persistent reductions in survival rates below the replacement level; and increased frequency of catastrophic mortality (die-off) events. Probabilities of recovery appear to be more sensitive to persistent reductions in survival than to increased probability of die-off events. The current lower benchmarks on spawner abundance and fishing mortality might not be sufficiently precautionary to allow recovery under those conditions.},

Alternative benchmarks have been proposed for data-limited Conservation Units (CUs) using percentiles of the observed spawner abundance time-series. However, these benchmarks have not been evaluated against stock-recruitment benchmarks currently used to assess status on abundances for data-rich CUs. Our goals were to evaluate percentile-based benchmarks against stock-recruitment based benchmarks accounting for high uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates, and age-at-maturity. We used two approaches to evaluate benchmarks based on a retrospective comparison through the historical record and a prospective simulation model under numerous hypothetical future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach for providing assessments that accounts for uncertainties in benchmarks, and provide advice on the applicability of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon relative to stock-recruitment benchmarks used for data-rich CUs. In general, our results support the application of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high ({\textgreater}2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate (≤40\%). However, we suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks (and the consideration of alternatives) when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. Under these conditions, concurrent declines in abundances and percentile benchmarks can results in status assessments that are more optimistic than those from stock-recruitment benchmarks due to shifting baselines.},

In exploited systems, however, management goals to preserve diversity may be in tension with harvest objectives. For example, ﬁsheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of ﬁsheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a Paciﬁc salmon stock aggregate and its ﬁshery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock ﬁsheries inﬂuences management performance. We focused on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon ﬁsheries. Additionally, we examined how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock ﬁsheries may change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We found that increasing single-stock ﬁshery allocations increased aggregate abundance and improved the status of some stocks relative to their conservation benchmarks. However, these improvements did not occur uniformly–relatively abundant, productive stocks exhibited no change, or even declines, in conservation performance as single-stock ﬁshery allocations increased. Furthermore, diﬀerences in performance between mixed- and single-stock ﬁsheries were reduced when productivity was uniformly low, when the mixedstock ﬁshery was managed conservatively, or when mortality during freshwater migrations was high. While single-stock ﬁsheries can increase the probability that conservation-based objectives will be met, they are not a panacea and may only be eﬀective when speciﬁc conditions are met.},

However, the data required to quantify status are often limited, and it is important to understand how assessments of status may be biased by assumptions in data analysis. For Paciﬁc salmon, biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and spawner–recruitment (SR) analyses often involve “run reconstructions” that impute missing spawner data, expand observed spawner abundance to account for unmonitored streams, assign catch to individual stocks, and quantify age-at-return. Using a stochastic simulation approach, we quantiﬁed how common assumptions in run reconstructions biased assessments of biological status based on spawner abundance. We found that status assessments were robust to most common assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase rates of status misclassiﬁcation. Our results lend conﬁdence to biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and SR analyses, even in the face of incomplete data.},

Model averaging and ensemble methods were used to combine the results of converged models for each species. Model averaging was based on both predictive (i.e., cross-validation, AIC) and retrospective performance metrics. Models allowing large shifts in M provided the best fit to observed data for both species and were also regarded as the most plausible. For Atlantic Cod, variance in biomass estimates among the individual models was very high and multimodel estimates were sensitive to the relative weight given to competing models. In contrast, converged Yellowtail Flounder models produced broadly similar output and multimodel estimates were more robust to model weights. Our results suggest that the plausibility of competing models should be scrutinized, particularly when structural uncertainty is high.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using the ensemble modelling paradigm to fully capture assessment uncertainty and improve the robustness of advice provision. We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientiﬁc advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of ﬁsh populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the “best” model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model conﬁgurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

Changes in distribution may indicate the loss of genetically distinct subpopulations, the deterioration of habitat capacity, or both. The distribution of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) among spawning locations has recently been recognized as an important component of status assessment by USA and Canadian management agencies, but metrics of spawning distribution have not been rigorously evaluated. We evaluated three metrics of spawning distribution and four sampling designs for their ability to detect simulated contractions in the production of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). We simulated population dynamics at 100 sites using a spawner–recruit model that incorporated natural variability in recruitment, age-at-maturity, dispersal, and measurement error in observations of abundance. Sensitivity analyses revealed that high observation error and straying of spawners from their natal streams may mask changes in distribution. Furthermore, monitoring only sites with high spawner abundance, as is often practiced, failed to capture the simulated contraction of production, emphasizing the importance of matching monitoring programs with assessment objectives.},

	abstract = {A thrust toward fisheries co-management systems occurred globally throughout the 1990s. This was partially influenced by the collapse of groundfish stocks including the iconic northern cod and other fisheries resources in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). The management system for NL snow crab burgeoned during this period, largely in the absence of biological information for the resource. There is a high volume of theoretical literature advocating for the benefits of fisheries co-management, but little documented perspectives from fisheries scientists actively engaged in such management systems, nor literature detailing how co-management regimes could affect scientific research or assessment programs. In this paper, in context of a large fishery, we provide specific examples of how co-management processes can influence scientific research and monitoring programs and the biological functioning of important marine resources. We undertake critical evaluation on topics including spatial scales of management, fishery timing, fishery closures, collaborative research, and harvester perceptions of stock size. We conclude there are both scientific advantages and disadvantages to operating within co-management systems, but that the NL snow crab management system has evolved to promote processes problematic to provision of the best possible science advice. We conclude that adaptive co-management measures are required to address several current challenges in order to maximize scientific value within this system. In general, the paper demonstrates how flexibility is needed by all partners involved in resource comanagement systems to adapt to fundamental scientific principles inherent in changing methodologies and the generation of knowledge.},

	abstract = {Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) are an important forage ﬁsh for many predators, and they also support the largest commercial ﬁshery by weight on the U.S. East Coast. Menhaden management has been working toward ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden’s role in the ecosystem. The goal of this work was to develop menhaden ERPs using ecosystem models. An existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf (NWACS) was reduced in complexity from 61 to 17 species/functional groups. The new NWACS model of intermediate complexity for ecosystems (NWACS-MICE) serves to link the dynamics of menhaden with key managed predators. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were determined to be most sensitive to menhaden harvest and therefore served as an indicator of ecosystem impacts. ERPs were based on the tradeoff relationship between the equilibrium biomass of striped bass and menhaden ﬁshing mortality (F). The ERPs were deﬁned as the menhaden F rates that maintain striped bass at their biomass target and threshold when striped bass are ﬁshed at their Ftarget, and all other modeled species were ﬁshed at status quo levels. These correspond to an ERP Ftarget of 0.19 and an ERP Fthreshold of 0.57, which are lower than the single species reference points by 30–40\%, but higher than current (2017) menhaden F. The ERPs were then fed back into the agestructured stock assessment model projections to provide information on total allowable catch. The ERPs developed in this study were adopted by the Atlantic menhaden Management Board, marking a shift toward ecosystem-based ﬁshery management for this economically and ecologically important species.},

	abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for ﬁsh and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess ﬁsh stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model conﬁguration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock’ paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally eﬃciently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random eﬀects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Eﬃcient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood’ paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require speciﬁcation of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to conﬁgure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random eﬀects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be ﬂexible and modiﬁable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

Classical population growth models, applied widely in fisheries science, assume that per capita offspring production increases as abundance declines (compensation). However, slow or absent recovery by many depleted fishes might reflect unexpectedly weak compensation or the presence of Allee effects (depensation). Using meta-analytical techniques to describe reproductive dynamics, we find considerable variability among 207 exploited marine fish stocks (104 species) in how standardized per capita population growth changes with abundance. Although many species exhibit strong compensatory dynamics (negative density dependence), others show much weaker compensation than expected, and some exhibit evidence of an Allee effect, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Alaskan walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). As data at low levels of abundance become increasingly available, it appears that compensation, while strong in some species, is comparatively weak or nonexistent in others, thus providing an explanation for why the recovery of some depleted stocks, despite reductions in exploitation, has been considerably less than what classic models of population growth would otherwise suggest.},

Despite ample evidence of density-dependent selection, the inﬂuence of prey density on predatory selection patterns has seldom been investigated empirically. We used 20 years of ﬁeld data on brown bears (Ursus arctos) foraging on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Alaska, to test the hypothesis that salmon density affects the strength of sizeselective predation. Measurements from 41,240 individual salmon were used to calculate variance-standardized selection differentials describing the direction and magnitude of selection. Across the time series, the intensity of predatory selection was inversely correlated with salmon density; greater selection for smaller salmon occurred at low salmon densities as bears’ tendency to kill larger-than-average salmon was magniﬁed. This novel connection between density dependence and selective predation runs contrary to some aspects of optimal foraging theory and differs from many observations of density-dependent selection because (1) the direction of selection remains constant while its magnitude changes as a function of density and (2) stronger selection is observed at low abundance. These ﬁndings indicate that sockeye salmon may be subject to ﬁshery-induced size selection from both direct mechanisms and latent effects of altered predatory selection patterns on the spawning grounds, resulting from reduced salmon abundance.},

Thus, assessment models assuming stationary reproductive output may inaccurately estimate biological reference points that inform harvest policies. We extended age-structured state-space spawner–recruit models to accommodate demographic time trends and ﬁshery selectivity to investigate temporal changes in reference points using Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We illustrate that observed demographic changes have likely reduced per capita reproductive output in an additive manner, for example, models including changes in both length-at-age and age composition showed larger declines than models incorporating only one time trend. Translated into biological reference points using a yield-per-recruit algorithm, we found escapement needed for maximum sustained catch has likely increased over time, but the magnitude further depended on size-selective harvest (i.e., larger increases for reference points based on larger mesh gillnets). Compared to traditional salmon assessments, our approach that acknowledges demographic time trends allows more complete use of available data and facilitates evaluating trade-offs among gear-speciﬁc harvest policies.},

	abstract = {Life history diversity of imperiled Paciﬁc salmon Oncorhynchus spp. substantially contributes to their persistence, and conservation of such diversity is a critical element of recovery efforts. Preserving and restoring diversity of life history traits depends in part on environmental factors affecting their expression. We analyzed relationships between annual hydrograph patterns and life history traits (spawn timing, age at spawning, age at outmigration, and body size) of Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to identify environmental indicators of current and historic diversity. Based on mean monthly ﬂow patterns, we identiﬁed three hydrologic regimes: snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, and transitional. Chinook populations in snowmelt-dominated areas contained higher proportions of the stream-type life history (juvenile residence {\textgreater}1 year in freshwater), had older spawners, and tended to spawn earlier in the year than populations in rainfall-dominated areas. There are few extant Puget Sound populations dominated by the stream-type life history, as several populations with high proportions of stream-type ﬁsh have been extirpated by construction of dams that prevent migration into snowmelt-dominated reaches. The few extant populations are thus a high priority for conservation. The low level of genetic distinction between stream-type and ocean-type (juvenile residence {\textless}1 year in freshwater) life histories suggests that allowing some portion of extant populations to recolonize habitats above dams might allow re-expression of suppressed life history characteristics, creating a broader spatial distribution of the stream-type life history. Climate change ultimately may limit the effectiveness of some conservation efforts, as stream-type Chinook may be dependent on a diminishing snowmelt-dominated habitat.},

Using data from 47 North American sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations, we present evidence that the magnitude and direction of climate and competition effects vary over large spatial scales. In the south, a warm ocean and abundant salmon competitors combined to strongly reduce sockeye productivity, whereas in the north, a warm ocean substantially increased productivity and offset the negative effects of competition at sea. From 2005 to 2015, the approximately 82 million adult pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) produced annually from hatcheries were estimated to have reduced the productivity of southern sockeye salmon by ϳ15\%, on average. In contrast, for sockeye at the northwestern end of their range, the same level of hatchery production was predicted to have reduced the positive effects of a warming ocean by ϳ50\% (from a ϳ10\% to a ϳ5\% increase in productivity, on average). These ﬁndings reveal spatially dependent effects of climate and competition on sockeye productivity and highlight the need for international discussions about large-scale hatchery production.},

	abstract = {Fishery managers often rely on forecasts of future population abundance to set allowable harvest quotas or exploitation rates. While there has been substantial research devoted to identifying environmental factors that can predict recruitment for individual populations, such correlations often degrade over time, thereby limiting their utility for management. Conversely, examining multiple populations at once to detect shared, spatially structured patterns can offer insights into their recruitment dynamics that are advantageous for forecasting. Here, we develop a population dynamics model for natural origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) stocks in Washington State that leverages spatial and temporal autocorrelation in marine survival to improve one-yearahead forecasts of adult returns. Executed in a Bayesian hierarchical integrated modelling framework, our spatiotemporal approach incorporates multiple data types and shares information among stocks to estimate key biological parameters that are informative for forecasting. Retrospective evaluation of one-year-ahead forecast skill indicated that the spatiotemporal integrated population model (ST-IPM) outperformed existing forecasts of Washington State coho salmon returns by 25–38 \% on average. Moreover, the ST-IPM estimates parameters that were previously non-identifiable for many stocks, and propagates uncertainty from multiple contributing data sources into model forecasts. Our results add to a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of spatio­ temporal and integrated approaches for modelling population dynamics, and the framework developed here has broad applications to the assessment and management of coho salmon in Washington State and elsewhere throughout their range.},

The structure of the management strategy can be selected to attempt to satisfy desired (but conﬂicting) management objectives. MSE was used to assess the performance of the current management strategy and an alternative management strategy (the “dynamic B0” strategy) for the ﬁshery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), when age-1 recruitment was driven by climate. The relationships between age-1 abundance and climate indices (and the uncertainties associated with these relationships) were characterized within an age-structured operating model that was ﬁtted to the data for GOA walleye pollock. Projections into the future were based on the ﬁtted relationships and predictions of those indices from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models, using the current or the alternative management strategy to determine catch limits. Management performance (the ability to leave the stock close to the management reference level and achieve high and stable catches) deteriorated when age-1 recruitment was forced by climate, although stocks were kept near the reference level on average. In addition, the ability to estimate management-related quantities, such as spawning biomass, deteriorated markedly when recruitment was forced by climate. Performance was sensitive to the choice of IPCC dataset and, in particular, estimation and management performance was poorest (outcomes most variable) for the IPCC datasets that led to the greatest variation in recruitment to the ﬁshery. Although basing management on a “dynamic B0” management strategy led to improved management and estimation performance, the magnitude of the improvement was slight.},

Management strategies can be modiﬁed to use environmental data using the “dynamic B0” concept, and changing the set of years used to deﬁne biomass reference points. Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The “mechanistic approach” estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the ﬁshed species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the “empirical approach” examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known. As such, until the skill of stock projection models improves, it seems more appropriate to consider the implications of plausible broad forecasts related to how biological parameters may change in the future as a way to assess the robustness of management strategies, rather than attempting speciﬁc predictions per se.},

There are multiple ways to calculate BRPs when biological parameters are time varying. Using summer ﬂounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a case study, we investigated time-varying approaches in concert with climate-linked population models to understand the impact of environmentally driven variability in natural mortality, recruitment, and size-at-age on two commonly used BRPs ½B0ðtÞ and F35\%(t)]. We used the following two approaches to calculate time-varying BRPs: dynamic-BRP and moving-average-BRP. We quantiﬁed the variability and uncertainty of different climate dependencies and estimation approaches, attributed BRP variation to variation in life-history processes, and evaluated how using different approaches impacts estimates of stock status. Results indicate that the dynamic-BRP approach using the climate-linked natural mortality model produced the least variable reference points compared to others calculated. Summer ﬂounder stock status depended on the estimation approach and climate model used. These results emphasize that understanding climate dependencies is important for summer ﬂounder reference points and perhaps other species, and careful consideration is warranted when considering what time-varying approach to use, ideally based upon simulation studies within a proposed set of management procedures.},

	abstract = {Reference points identify benchmarks, thresholds, or decision points for fisheries management, and are commonly defined by stock status indicators that presume equilibrium population conditions in the absence of fishing (e.g., equilibrium biomass, B0). However, equilibrium population biomass may be an inappropriate reference level when stock productivity is influenced by environmental change, predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem thresholds, and myriad other factors. Simulations were conducted to compare equilibrium-based (static B0) and non-equilibrium based (dynamic B0) indicators of stock status under alternative states of nature driven by time-varying recruitment dynamics (productivity regime), fishing dynamics (mortality regime), and species life history. Using dynamic B0 often implied a different state of the stock under directional productivity regime shifts, but was more similar to static B0 reference points under cyclic or white noise productivity scenarios. Uncertainty in stock status arising from incorrectly identifying changes in system productivity generally outweighed the uncertainty associated with initial equilibrium conditions. Empirical results across 18 U.S. West Coast groundfish stock assessments indicated predominantly small differences ({\textless} 10\%) between static B0 and dynamic B0 indicators of stock status, although in some cases differences were large (up to 72\%) or spanned reference points that trigger management action. Although caution is warranted when considering dynamic reference points, this paper shows these approaches are likely to be most useful when stock productivity shifts directionally, if that productivity signal can be correctly ascertained.},

A changing climate will likely have differing effects on different species; some will ﬂourish, some will ﬂounder. Management targets for ﬁshing mortality and spawning biomass are often calculated by assuming stationary population processes, but under climate change, this assumption may be violated. Non-stationary population processes can introduce bias into estimates of biomass from stock assessments and calculations of target ﬁshing mortalities and biomasses. However, few accepted frameworks exist for incorporating the changing inﬂuence of the environment on exploited populations into management strategies. Identifying changes in population processes due to environmental inﬂuences is important in order to enable climate-enhanced management strategy evaluations to elucidate the potential beneﬁts and costs of changing management targets. Cost/beneﬁt analyses will also be useful when coincidentally caught species respond differently to environmental change.},

In contrast to climate forecasting approaches, we track integrated signals of change for example populations in a climatically forced region and use stochastic dynamic programming to compare the performance of a range of management-ready policies over all possible future states. Our main results highlight: (i) that biomass-linked harvest control rules (HCRs) can partially compensate for changing production, even if the HCR is time invariant; and (ii) that the form of utility (e.g. risk neutral or risk averse) can result in remarkably diﬀerent optimal decision paths. Performance over future horizons degrades marginally from dynamic HCRs to static HCRs (except at low productivity where diﬀerences are more pronounced) but markedly when the biomass level is ignored altogether, as is the case in many managed ﬁsh populations globally. Understanding the processes whereby climate aﬀects productivity is important for interpreting past data, but forecasts are not needed for tactical decision making now. Instead, we argue that the priorities for managing ﬁsh stocks inﬂuenced by climate change are to: measure the current productivity, assess the current abundance of the stock, and respond with a dynamic HCR.},

We found strong evidence of positive covariation among spawner-to-recruit survival rates of wild stocks within regions and between certain adjacent regions (e.g., correlations from 0.3 to 0.7) but little evidence of covariation between stocks of distant regions (e.g., separated by 1,000 km or more). Similarly, for hatchery stocks from Washington, British Columbia, and southeast Alaska, positive covariation in the indices of fry-to-recruit survival rate occurred only within regions and between certain adjacent regions. These patterns suggest that important environmental processes affecting interannual variation in spawner-to-recruit survival rates of chum salmon operate at local or regional spatial scales rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. These results are similar to our previous ﬁndings for sockeye salmon O. nerka and pink salmon O. gorbuscha and help identify the spatial characteristics of environmental variables required to improve forecasting models and better understand the effects of climatic changes on salmon productivity. Our ﬁnding that local or regional-scale processes primarily affect productivity differs from that of other studies, which suggest that large, ocean-basin-scale processes predominate. However, the latter studies were mostly based on time series of aggregate catch data, which provide limited spatial resolution and are potentially confounded by several factors.},

This indicates that important environmental processes affecting variation in sockeye survival rate from spawners to recruits operate at regional spatial scales, rather than at the larger, ocean-basin scale. The observed covariation in survival rates of Bristol Bay stocks appears to be due to a combination of both freshwater and, to a greater degree, marine processes. Bristol Bay sockeye stocks showed a dramatic and persistent increase in survival rates coinciding with the abrupt changes in the North Pacific environment in the mid-1970s; however, there was little evidence of a similar response for Fraser River stocks.},

Non-displacement rearing occurs if juveniles originating from the same drainage as the hatchery are released back into the natal stream. Displacement rearing occurs if part of the rearing and release strategy occurs at a foreign drainage or includes the marine environment. We compared straying between non-displacement and three types of displacement releases where: (1) juveniles are transported, reared in a central hatchery and released back into natal drainage (satellite); (2) or transported, reared in a central or recipient hatchery and released in a foreign drainage (transplant); (3) or reared and released directly into the marine environment away from the home drainage (out-estuary). Compared with non-displacement rearing, displacement-reared ®sh were between two and ®ve times more likely to stray (2.1±5.3\% vs 1.2\%). Out-estuary releases had the highest stray rates of the displacement rearing types and were suspected of being least successful at imprinting on the home stream. Analysis of hybrid and transplanted stocks suggested that there was a genetic component to homing. A hybrid stock was three times more likely to stray than the natal stock released at the same time and location (6.2\% vs 2.4\%). Transplanted ®sh without exposure to their ancestral drainage were more likely to stray back to the ancestral drainage than non-transplanted ®sh released at the same time and location (2.9\% vs 0.1\%). Approximately 50\% of the stray migrants were recovered within 30 km of the release site, indicating that the highest risk of straying may occur during the transition from bi-coordinate navigation to imprinted natal stream clues. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We describe a bootstrap procedure that follows the trapezoidal AUC method and incorporates the uncertainty associated with ﬁsh counts, the shape of the spawner curve, observer efﬁciency, and residence time. However, the procedure does not incorporate all sources of uncertainty or address the problems posed by sparse surveys or nonzero ﬁrst or last counts. For the peak count method, the procedure was modiﬁed to include the uncertainty from ﬁsh counts, observer efﬁciency, the expansion factor, and the timing of scheduled ﬂights with respect to peak spawning activity. Data from spring-run, stream-type chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Nicola River, British Columbia, were used to demonstrate the procedures’ applications. Replicate aerial spawner counts were similar and repeatable, and annual residence times were consistent over 4 years. The AUC escapement estimates were precise, reliable, and accurate when compared with independent mark–recapture escapement estimates, whereas the peak count escapement estimates were precise but less reliable and accurate. We expect that AUC escapement estimates calculated from the mean residence time of 4 years will be less biased (Ϫ8\% to ϩ5\%) than peak count estimates from the mean expansion factor of 4 years (Ϫ14\% to ϩ21\%). The procedures that we describe for incorporating uncertainty into AUC and peak count escapement estimation should enable ﬁsheries biologists to more adequately assess changes in abundance and stock status.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes progress to date on the development of reference points for the management of various marine invertebrate species commercially harvested in Canada. The implementation of the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada requires the definition of reference points reflecting the productivity and reproductive capacity of a stock. The different invertebrate species commonly fished in Canada exhibit a very diverse range of life history characteristics. For these species, reproductive success will be a function of life history factors such as effective female fecundity, spawning opportunities for females, spatial patterns of age–size structure, the relationship between spawner density and fertilization success — especially for broadcast spawners with sedentary or sessile adults, spatial and temporal aspects of breeding areas, and the relationship between benthic settlement success and habitat suitability. For many species the time period between spawning and actually being able to observe recruits may be long enough so that cumulative environmental influences on survival could radically reduce year-class strength. Also, there is often a mismatch between managed areas and stock area so that recruitment success in one area may be affected by spawning success in another area. The lack of adequate models to account for these complexities has often resulted in the use of empirical methods to define the type of reference points expected by the DFO PA policy. To date, empirical methods have used either an estimate of or an indicator of population biomass or abundance to represent the productivity of the stock. Given that biomass alone is an incomplete measure of productivity, many invertebrate stock assessments rely on secondary indicators such as population size, composition-based and sex ratio-based growth changes, spawner abundance or biomass, abundance of prerecruits, predator abundance, environmental changes and spatial patterns of density, to modify stock status advice. For many sedentary species (e.g., bivalves and echinoderms), primarily spatially-based limits and targets for fisheries may be more appropriate. However, methods for spatial approaches still need to be developed.},

Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (1938–2007) data for 18 sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population’s yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population’s status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.},

	abstract = {For ﬁsheries with multiple, competing objectives, identifying and applying reference points for management can present difﬁcult trade-offs between long-term biological and shorter-term socioeconomic considerations. The term biological benchmarks is proposed to demarcate zones of population status based on conservation and production considerations. These scientiﬁcally derived benchmarks contrast with management reference points that generally require additional shorter-term socioeconomic information best obtained through public consultations. This paper illustrates the distinction between biological benchmarks and management reference points with a case study on Paciﬁc salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). In Canada, the management and assessment of wild Paciﬁc salmon are guided by a major 2005 conservation policy, which calls for the identiﬁcation of biological benchmarks to categorize status of demographically isolated populations, and decision-support tools, such as management reference points, to integrate biological information with appropriate social and economic information. In the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), the selection of management reference points for sockeye salmon (O. nerka) ﬁsheries explicitly considered trade-offs between the probability of meeting long-term biological objectives on component populations and harvest objectives on population aggregates. Decisions about reference points were made in a consultative process that included extensive stakeholder engagement. Other agencies are urged to distinguish biological benchmarks from management reference points to ensure transparency in the relative inﬂuence of biological versus socioeconomic information in decision making.},

              Widespread declines in Atlantic and Pacific salmon (
              Salmo salar
              and
              Oncorhynchus
              spp.) have tracked recent climate changes, but managers still lack quantitative projections of the viability of any individual population in response to future climate change. To address this gap, we assembled a vast database of survival and other data for eight wild populations of threatened Chinook salmon (
              O. tshawytscha
              ). For each population, we evaluated climate impacts at all life stages and modeled future trajectories forced by global climate model projections. Populations rapidly declined in response to increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors across diverse model assumptions and climate scenarios. Strong density dependence limited the number of salmon that survived early life stages, suggesting a potentially efficacious target for conservation effort. Other solutions require a better understanding of the factors that limit survival at sea. We conclude that dramatic increases in smolt survival are needed to overcome the negative impacts of climate change for this threatened species.},

One such suite of ecosystems is on the remote North and Central Coast (NCC) of British Columbia, where sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) rear in more than 150 lakes. Given their remoteness and limited resources for assessment, limnological and population monitoring in many of these lakes has been periodic or absent, limiting understanding of the status of populations and their habitats. Lake photosynthetic rate (PR) estimates are foundational to models of sockeye salmon nursery lake productive capacity. Using data from 61 lakes across the NCC, we compared a suite of landscape and lake variables in an information theoretic framework producing a set of models relating these characteristics to lake PR. A categorical variable related to lake biogeochemistry—whether a lake is humic stained, clear, or glacially turbid—was the most important variable predicting lake PR and was included in all models. Lake surface area relative to upstream catchment size and lake perimeter-to-surface-area ratio were also important, with smaller upstream catchments yielding higher production, and high shoreline complexity correlated with lower productivity as measured by limnetic PR. Model-averaged predictions of PR from the four models with the lowest residual error were created for 96 lakes currently lacking limnological assessments. These landscape models represent a valuable starting point for evaluating lake-specific carrying capacities for data-poor sockeye salmon populations under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy.},

	abstract = {The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species was increasingly used during the 1980s to assess the conservation status of species for policy and planning purposes. This use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and extinction. But given major differences between species, the threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty, poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the development of national red lists need to take account of some assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.},

We identiﬁed a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied {\textgreater}90\% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85\% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.},

	abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model’s predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

            The current fish stock assessment process in Europe can be very resource- and time-intensive. The scientists involved require a very particular set of skills, acquired over their career, drawing from biology, ecology, statistics, mathematical modelling, oceanography, fishery policy, and computing. There is a particular focus on producing a single “best” stock assessment model, but as fishery science advances, there are clear needs to address a range of hypotheses and uncertainties, from large-scale issues such as climate change to specific ones, such as high observation error on young hake. Key to our discussion is the use of the assessment for all frameworks to translate hypotheses into models. We propose a change to the current stock assessment procedure, driven by the use of model averaging to address a range of plausible hypotheses, where increased collaboration between the varied disciplines within fishery science will result in more robust advice.},

This assumes that SSLs residing around northern Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada) target Sockeye Salmon for just a few weeks during the peak of their run. It is a reasonable enough assumption to warrant immediate priority for field research on SSL behavior and diets during the migration period. We evaluated the plausibility of the assumption with a variety of approaches ranging from simple estimates of maximum SSL consumption to partitioning of observed marine mortality rates and analysis of SSL foraging behavior to show that SSLs could have caused the decline in productivity and abundance of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon.},

Changes in numbers of seals since the 1970s were associated with a 74\% decrease (95\% CI: −85\%, −64\%) in maximum sustainable yield in Chinook stocks. In contrast, hatchery releases were signiﬁcantly correlated with Chinook productivity in only one of 20 populations. Our ﬁndings are consistent with recent research on predator diets and bioenergetics modeling that suggest there is a relationship between harbour seal predation on juvenile Chinook and reduced marine survival in parts of the eastern Paciﬁc.

Between the two watersheds, 196 and 265 g of Calliphora larvae per metre of spawning length (4 and 7 million larvae for whole watersheds) were generated from salmon carcass transfer.

              C of spring-emerging adult Calliphora revealed that {\textgreater}80\% of individuals had salmon-based signatures. Flies are a dominant consumer and vector of salmon nutrients in terrestrial habitats and supplement the diet of at least 16 vertebrate and 22 invertebrate species. Anticipated further declines of salmon in the North Pacific can be expected to further erode the complex associations coupling marine and terrestrial ecosystems.},

              Oncorhynchus
              spp.) returning to streams around the North Pacific Rim provide a nutrient subsidy to these ecosystems. While many species of animals feed directly on salmon carcasses each autumn, salmon-derived nutrients can also be stored in coastal habitats throughout the year. The effects of this storage legacy on vertebrates in other seasons are not well understood, especially in estuaries, which can receive a large portion of post-spawning salmon nutrients. We examine the effects of residual salmon-derived nutrients, forest habitats and landscape features on summer breeding birds in estuary forests. We compared models containing environmental variables and combined chum (
              Oncorhynchus keta
              ) and pink (
              Oncorhynchus gorbuscha
              ) salmon biomass to test predictions concerning bird density and diversity. We discovered that total bird, insectivore, golden-crowned kinglet and Pacific wren densities and Shannon's diversity in the summer were strongly predicted by salmon biomass in the autumn. For most metrics, this relationship approaches an asymptote beyond 40 000 kg of salmon biomass. Foliage height diversity, watershed catchment area and estuary area were also important predictors of avian communities. Our study suggests that the legacy of salmon nutrients influences breeding bird density and diversity in estuaries that vary across a wide gradient of spawning salmon biomass.},

We explored a wide range of scenarios for ocean and freshwater conditions and the response of salmon productivity (adult recruits per spawner) to those conditions. Our results show that stock assessments based on historical relationships between salmon productivity and climate-driven oceanographic conditions will likely perform poorly when those relationships change, even when such changes are anticipated and incorporated into stock assessment models in a timely manner. Estimating the relative importance of climate-driven oceanographic influences as a driver of sockeye productivity will be difficult, especially if climatic changes occur rapidly and concurrently with other disturbances. Thus, better understanding of the mechanisms by which climatic changes and other drivers influence salmon productivity may be essential to avoid undesirable management outcomes. As well, an expansion of monitoring of juvenile salmon abundances on more salmon stocks is needed to help distinguish the effects of different drivers.},

            Incorporating ecological covariates into fishery stock assessments may improve estimates, but most covariates are estimated with error. Model selection criteria are often used to identify support for covariates, have some limitations and rely on assumptions that are often violated. For a more rigorous evaluation of ecological covariates, we used four popular selection criteria to identify covariates influencing natural mortality or recruitment in a Bayesian stock assessment of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Within this framework, covariates were incorporated either as fixed effects or as latent variables (i.e. covariates have associated error). We found most support for pink salmon increasing natural mortality, which was selected by three of four criteria. There was ambiguous support for other fixed effects on natural mortality (walleye pollock and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and recruitment (hatchery-released juvenile pink salmon and a 1989 regime shift). Generally, similar criteria values among covariates suggest no clear evidence for a consistent effect of any covariate. Models with covariates as latent variables were sensitive to prior specification and may provide potentially very different results. We recommend using multiple criteria and exploring different statistical assumptions about covariates for their use in stock assessment.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have debated the nature of density dependence in natural populations for decades, and efforts to detect density dependence from time series of abundance data have paralleled these debates. Yet due to the correlative nature of time series data, these undertakings have been statistically problematic. Most analyses of density dependence have focused on simple population models (i.e., non-overlapping generations), but in reality most vertebrates exhibit more complex life histories, and this complexity has been incorporated into population models in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, adding complexity to population models can further exacerbate efforts to detect density dependence. We examined the effect of adding age structure when inadequate data exist in support; to demonstrate this effect, we adopted Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) as our study organism. Most salmon populations are semelparous and have variable age at maturity. Salmon populations (and many other fish species populations) are typically modeled in terms of numbers of recruits arising from spawners in a given brood year. Recruits are enumerated as they return as adults to spawn, and proper assignment of recruits tc brood year requires age information. Unfortunately, while adult counts are common, detailed age information is not. A common practice is to apply long-term averages of age composition to returning adults to "reconstruct" time series of recruits. Here, by conducting simulations and analyzing data from natural populations, we demonstrated that this practice leads to a biased portrayal of density dependence by overestimating recruits from small spawning classes and underestimating recruits from large spawning classes. Also, productivity was overestimated and variance was underestimated, which could lead to overly optimistic predictions of extinction risk or overharvesting.},
