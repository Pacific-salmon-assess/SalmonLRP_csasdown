  abstract = {Management of anadromous salmon stocks is usually based on an estimate of the spawner-recruitment relationship. A wide variety of estimation approaches have been developed, from simple to complex, and some worthwhile methodologies and auxiliary data are underutilized. The types and quality of the data available determine the most appropriate assessment methodology and the reliability of the assessment results. The management strategies available and the performance of these strategies are likewise highly dependent on the available data. This review gives an overview of the range of assessment methodologies, from the ad-hoc to hierarchical Bayesian state-space approaches. It emphasizes the central role of data; data types, data deficiencies, auxiliary information such as environmental indices, habitat characteristics, and similar stocks, and the effects of the data on the quality of guidance to managers.},

  abstract = {The document was prepared in support of an advisory process meeting to produce a technical guidance document to assist science practitioners responsible for developing the science elements of the Precautionary Approach (PA) framework. It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used dynamic factor analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

  abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

In many Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. fishery jurisdictions, management only uses ``target reference points''\textemdash the specific numerical management objective intended to bring about some fishery benefit. There are several reasons to adopt limit reference points, and jurisdictions without previously defined limit reference points could adopt them in order to align better with the Magnuson\textendash Stevens Act (American fisheries) or, more importantly, to facilitate cross-jurisdiction sustainability assessments, which are increasingly needed for certifications of sustainability. In actual practice, the stock size of 0.5 times a target reference point has been used as a limit reference point for some Pacific salmon fisheries, or at least as a proxy for a limit reference point. We term this point the ``minimum stock size threshold,'' following a convention already in use, and we note that limit reference points defined this way are increasingly being accepted as a standard either because of justification based on simulation and fishery principles or for purely pragmatic reasons.},

We compare seven methods to calculate MSY, FMSY and BMSY by modelling constant, stochastic (uncorrelated), and autocorrelated SRRs using simulations and two case studies [Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada]. Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and largemagnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and FMSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of BMSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between fishing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overfishing by going beyond FMSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable fisheries.},
