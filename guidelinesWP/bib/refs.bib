A wide variety of estimation approaches have been developed, from simple to complex, and some worthwhile methodologies and auxiliary data are underutilized. The types and quality of the data available determine the most appropriate assessment methodology and the reliability of the assessment results. The management strategies available and the performance of these strategies are likewise highly dependent on the available data. This review gives an overview of the range of assessment methodologies, from the ad-hoc to hierarchical Bayesian state-space approaches. It emphasizes the central role of data; data types, data deficiencies, auxiliary information such as environmental indices, habitat characteristics, and similar stocks, and the effects of the data on the quality of guidance to managers.},

  abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is the process of using simulation testing with feedback to examine the robustness of candidate management strategies to error and uncertainty. The structure of the management strategy can be selected to attempt to satisfy desired (but conflicting) management objectives. MSE was used to assess the performance of the current management strategy and an alternative management strategy (the ``dynamic B0'' strategy) for the fishery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), when age-1 recruitment was driven by climate. The relationships between age-1 abundance and climate indices (and the uncertainties associated with these relationships) were characterized within an age-structured operating model that was fitted to the data for GOA walleye pollock. Projections into the future were based on the fitted relationships and predictions of those indices from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models, using the current or the alternative management strategy to determine catch limits. Management performance (the ability to leave the stock close to the management reference level and achieve high and stable catches) deteriorated when age-1 recruitment was forced by climate, although stocks were kept near the reference level on average. In addition, the ability to estimate management-related quantities, such as spawning biomass, deteriorated markedly when recruitment was forced by climate. Performance was sensitive to the choice of IPCC dataset and, in particular, estimation and management performance was poorest (outcomes most variable) for the IPCC datasets that led to the greatest variation in recruitment to the fishery. Although basing management on a ``dynamic B0'' management strategy led to improved management and estimation performance, the magnitude of the improvement was slight.},

  abstract = {Life history diversity of imperiled Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. substantially contributes to their persistence, and conservation of such diversity is a critical element of recovery efforts. Preserving and restoring diversity of life history traits depends in part on environmental factors affecting their expression. We analyzed relationships between annual hydrograph patterns and life history traits (spawn timing, age at spawning, age at outmigration, and body size) of Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to identify environmental indicators of current and historic diversity. Based on mean monthly flow patterns, we identified three hydrologic regimes: snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, and transitional. Chinook populations in snowmelt-dominated areas contained higher proportions of the stream-type life history (juvenile residence {$>$}1 year in freshwater), had older spawners, and tended to spawn earlier in the year than populations in rainfall-dominated areas. There are few extant Puget Sound populations dominated by the stream-type life history, as several populations with high proportions of stream-type fish have been extirpated by construction of dams that prevent migration into snowmelt-dominated reaches. The few extant populations are thus a high priority for conservation. The low level of genetic distinction between stream-type and ocean-type (juvenile residence {$<$}1 year in freshwater) life histories suggests that allowing some portion of extant populations to recolonize habitats above dams might allow re-expression of suppressed life history characteristics, creating a broader spatial distribution of the stream-type life history. Climate change ultimately may limit the effectiveness of some conservation efforts, as stream-type Chinook may be dependent on a diminishing snowmelt-dominated habitat.},

However, equilibrium population biomass may be an inappropriate reference level when stock productivity is influenced by environmental change, predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem thresholds, and myriad other factors. Simulations were conducted to compare equilibrium-based (static B0) and non-equilibrium based (dynamic B0) indicators of stock status under alternative states of nature driven by time-varying recruitment dynamics (productivity regime), fishing dynamics (mortality regime), and species life history. Using dynamic B0 often implied a different state of the stock under directional productivity regime shifts, but was more similar to static B0 reference points under cyclic or white noise productivity scenarios. Uncertainty in stock status arising from incorrectly identifying changes in system productivity generally outweighed the uncertainty associated with initial equilibrium conditions. Empirical results across 18 U.S. West Coast groundfish stock assessments indicated predominantly small differences ({$<$} 10\%) between static B0 and dynamic B0 indicators of stock status, although in some cases differences were large (up to 72\%) or spanned reference points that trigger management action. Although caution is warranted when considering dynamic reference points, this paper shows these approaches are likely to be most useful when stock productivity shifts directionally, if that productivity signal can be correctly ascertained.},

We fit a rectilinear "hockey stick" model to 14 historical data sets of female spawner abundance and resulting smolt production and found that at low spawner abundance, the average productivity was about 85 smolts per female spawner. Variation in productivity among streams may be related to the quality of the stream habitat. We show how freshwater productivity can be combined with forecasts of marine survival to provide a limit reference point harvest rate. Our method will permit harvest rates to track changes in ocean productivity. We also used the historical data to estimate that, on average, a density of 19 female spawners{$\cdot$}km               -1               is required to fully seed freshwater habitats with juveniles. However, there was considerable variation among the streams that might limit the utility of this measure as a reference point. Uncertainty in the forecasts of marine survival and other parameters needs to be incorporated into our scheme before it can be considered a precautionary approach.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the scientific basis for the recovery objectives contained in the September 2004 draft recovery plans for Cultus and Sakinaw Lake sockeye salmon and Interior Fraser coho salmon. First, a brief review of recovery objectives for a variety of other North American salmonid recovery plans was conducted, and we concluded that the objectives of the 3 plans were consistent with current practice; the main difference was that the objectives were more quantitative than was usual in other jurisdictions. Next, objectives that were developed for purpose of conserving genetic resources in the endangered populations were compared to the recent literature and were found to be minimally adequate. In a review of population viability analysis (PVA) and its application to setting conservation targets, we concluded that demographically-based conservation goals in the order of 1,000 annual spawners was only adequate if there was an additional objective of maintaining positive population growth. We detailed and reviewed the evidence for depensatory mortality in Cultus Lake on juvenile sockeye salmon and concurred with the recovery team that there was reason to be concerned that at low spawner abundance reduced smolt production rates could inhibit recovery. Lastly, we documented the evidence used to develop a total escapement estimate for Interior Fraser coho salmon that would meet recovery objectives for individual populations and sub-populations. A comparison of the recovery objectives with recent historical abundances indicates that the recovery targets for the 3 salmon populations are all less than one third of recent maxima. Thus the teams have been consistent in interpreting recovery as an abundance at the lower range of the spectrum of values they might have considered, well below the carrying capacity of their habitats. We conclude that there is a need to develop plans to maintain population productivity to ensure persistence at the proposed recovery targets.}

Recovery measures that include a conservation breeding program, harvest management and a predator control program in Cultus Lake have been implemented. This report reviews the current status of the population and the efficacy of the recovery measures. We found that that status of the population has not improved since 2003 largely because of poor smolt-recruit survival, and the average number of spawners remains at about 1000 fish. Harvest rates have been reduced since the 1990s and the predator control program appears to have increased the survival of juveniles in the lake. Supplementation releases of juveniles from the captive breeding program to the lake have resulted in increasing numbers of returning hatchery adults, but their success as spawners in the wild remains unknown. Modelling suggests that under the current low smolt-recuit survival rates, recovery is only possible with the successful implementation of all recovery measures. We conclude that the recovery of the Cultus Lake sockeye salmon population is highly uncertain and that continued monitoring is needed to determine if the recovery actions are indeed reducing risks to the population}

It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

The model is a natural extension of traditional models, which only incorporate the negative effects of increasing density on fecundity and (or) survival. Because the new model is intrinsically nonlinear and because of convergence problems at local optima, we use a maximum likelihood approach with a global genetic search algorithm to estimate model parameters. Parameter uncertainty is obtained from the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Based on this new model, an extinction probability curve is developed using the parameter defining the Allee effects. This curve can readily be used to calculate the theoretical probability of extinction for a single brood line in one generation for any particular spawner number or biomass. Alternatively, because managers may wish to assign reference points corresponding to particular extinction probabilities, spawner numbers can be determined for these reference points. Two Pacific salmon populations, North Thompson coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chilko sockeye (O. nerka), are used to demonstrate the approach. It is found that the Allee effect parameter is statistically significant for the Thompson coho, but not for Chilko sockeye.},

In contrast to climate forecasting approaches, we track integrated signals of change for example populations in a climatically forced region and use stochastic dynamic programming to compare the performance of a range of management-ready policies over all possible future states. Our main results highlight: (i) that biomass-linked harvest control rules (HCRs) can partially compensate for changing production, even if the HCR is time invariant; and (ii) that the form of utility (e.g. risk neutral or risk averse) can result in remarkably different optimal decision paths. Performance over future horizons degrades marginally from dynamic HCRs to static HCRs (except at low productivity where differences are more pronounced) but markedly when the biomass level is ignored altogether, as is the case in many managed fish populations globally. Understanding the processes whereby climate affects productivity is important for interpreting past data, but forecasts are not needed for tactical decision making now. Instead, we argue that the priorities for managing fish stocks influenced by climate change are to: measure the current productivity, assess the current abundance of the stock, and respond with a dynamic HCR.},

Using data from 47 North American sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations, we present evidence that the magnitude and direction of climate and competition effects vary over large spatial scales. In the south, a warm ocean and abundant salmon competitors combined to strongly reduce sockeye productivity, whereas in the north, a warm ocean substantially increased productivity and offset the negative effects of competition at sea. From 2005 to 2015, the approximately 82 million adult pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) produced annually from hatcheries were estimated to have reduced the productivity of southern sockeye salmon by ϳ15\%, on average. In contrast, for sockeye at the northwestern end of their range, the same level of hatchery production was predicted to have reduced the positive effects of a warming ocean by ϳ50\% (from a ϳ10\% to a ϳ5\% increase in productivity, on average). These findings reveal spatially dependent effects of climate and competition on sockeye productivity and highlight the need for international discussions about large-scale hatchery production.},

While there has been substantial research devoted to identifying environmental factors that can predict recruitment for individual populations, such correlations often degrade over time, thereby limiting their utility for management. Conversely, examining multiple populations at once to detect shared, spatially structured patterns can offer insights into their recruitment dynamics that are advantageous for forecasting. Here, we develop a population dynamics model for natural origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) stocks in Washington State that leverages spatial and temporal autocorrelation in marine survival to improve one-yearahead forecasts of adult returns. Executed in a Bayesian hierarchical integrated modelling framework, our spatiotemporal approach incorporates multiple data types and shares information among stocks to estimate key biological parameters that are informative for forecasting. Retrospective evaluation of one-year-ahead forecast skill indicated that the spatiotemporal integrated population model (ST-IPM) outperformed existing forecasts of Washington State coho salmon returns by 25\textendash 38 \% on average. Moreover, the ST-IPM estimates parameters that were previously non-identifiable for many stocks, and propagates uncertainty from multiple contributing data sources into model forecasts. Our results add to a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of spatio\- temporal and integrated approaches for modelling population dynamics, and the framework developed here has broad applications to the assessment and management of coho salmon in Washington State and elsewhere throughout their range.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used dynamic factor analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

The first four correspond to the chum returning to Statistical Areas 7, 8, 9, and 10 and are referred as ``northern stocks''. The fifth stock is those fish returning to Area 11 (Seymour Inlet). The sixth stock comprises fish spawning in the ISA (Johnstone and Georgia straits) but excludes fish from the Fraser River. Our overall goal was to assess the status of these stocks and describe how status varied temporally between 1953- 2002. Status was based primarily on trends in escapement as well as a comparison of escapement to reference points. We calculated two reference points based on the long-term median escapement (LTME) that defined three zones (red:{$\leq$} 60\% LTME, amber:{$>$}60 \% LTME {$<$} escapement {$<$} 80\%LTME, and green: {$\geq$} 80\%LTME). We performed a similar analysis using total run sizes. Status variability within stock groupings was assessed by calculating and comparing relative rates of change in escapement per year for individual streams. Temporal variations in stock status were analysed by evaluating the stock status based on the complete time series and based on data from the last three generations only. Chum salmon in Areas 7 and 8 were generally in the green zone. While there are no apparent management concerns with these fish, we recommend that Area 7 chum should be monitored closely since total run size appears to have been reduced by \textasciitilde 22\% during the last three generations. We have some concerns for chum returning to Areas 9-11, and north-eastern Johnstone Strait (EJST). Although long and short-term trends in escapements to Area 9 were not negative, the median escapement and total run size during the last three generations were in the amber zone. Escapements in Area 10 showed a negative trend during the last three generations, although the median escapement was in the green zone. Inefficient escapement surveys during the last 3 generations might be responsible for this apparent decline in escapement. Escapements in Area 11 declined over time, and the median of the last three generations was in the amber zone while total run size was in the green zone. There was significant variability in patterns for the southern stocks. Stocks on both sides of Johnstone Strait have declined recently. The decline of the Eastern stock was the most drastic of all; recent escapements and total run sizes were in the red zones, both being reduced to less than half their long-term median. Interestingly, chum in North West Georgia Strait (NWGS) increased during the last three generations; escapements and total run size generally were in the green zone. This increase may be related to changing fishery practices on enhanced chum returning to this area. Chum returning to NEGS, SWGS, and SEGS had similar patterns to each other. All Georgia Strait stocks increased during the complete time series and during the last generations and were in the green zone.}

  abstract = {Canada's Wild Salmon Policy requires that quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics that delineate Red, Amber, and Green zones of status be established for all Conservation Units. Although candidate benchmarks have been identified from the scientific literature and previous management experience, they have not been evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the goals of the Wild Salmon Policy. Using a simulation model, we evaluated lower benchmarks on two classes of indicators (abundances and fishing mortality relative to productivity) on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. This technical document provides the methodology and results for those analyses and is a companion document to the overall synthesis paper "Indicators of Status and Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada's Wild Salmon Policy" (Holt et al. 2009). We considered the "worst-case" management scenario, with management decisions corresponding to CUs being depleted to the lower benchmark each year. Although unrealistic, this assumption provides an upper limit on the probability of extirpation and lower limit on the probability of recovery. We found that for metrics of spawner abundances, the lower benchmark, spawner abundance that will result in recovery to SMSY (spawner abundance at maximum sustained yield) in one generation under equilibrium conditions (Sgen), was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {$<$}25\%) over 100 years (for populations with equilibrium abundances {$>$} 15 000 spawners) and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {$>$}75\%) when uncertainties in all major components of the fishery system were accounted for. Furthermore, the probability of extirpation for Sgen was more robust to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY. For metrics of fishing mortality, the lower benchmark FMSY (fishing mortality at maximum sustained yield) was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability {$<$}25\%) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances {$>$} 30 000 spawners, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability {$>$}75\%), and its performance was more robust to variability in stock productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature. Based on those results and a risk classification scheme developed in DFO's Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009), we suggest deriving lower benchmarks on spawner abundances from Sgen and lower benchmarks on fishing mortality from FMSY. Further work will be required to identify specific risk tolerances of stakeholders in order to better inform the choice of lower benchmarks.},

  abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Fisheries Management Branch has requested that Science Branch provide advice, based on the Contractors' work, for science-based escapement and exploitation rate benchmarks for three PST management units and their component WSP conservation units of Southern BC Coho Salmon. Results of this assessment and advice arising from the Regional Peer Review process will be used to inform the ongoing development of WSP benchmarks, assessment of WSP conservation unit status and PST management reference points. This Science Advisory Report is from the November 4-5, 2014 and April 14, 2015 regional peer review on Determination of Escapement and Exploitation Rate Benchmarks for the Three Georgia Strait Southern BC Coho Management Units. Additional publications from this meeting will be posted on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Science Advisory Schedule as they become available.},

  abstract = {Fisheries managers use biological reference points (BRPs) as targets or limits on fishing and biomass to maintain productive levels of fish stock biomass. There are multiple ways to calculate BRPs when biological parameters are time varying. Using summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a case study, we investigated time-varying approaches in concert with climate-linked population models to understand the impact of environmentally driven variability in natural mortality, recruitment, and size-at-age on two commonly used BRPs {$\frac{1}{2}$}B0\dh t\TH{} and F35\%(t)]. We used the following two approaches to calculate time-varying BRPs: dynamic-BRP and moving-average-BRP. We quantified the variability and uncertainty of different climate dependencies and estimation approaches, attributed BRP variation to variation in life-history processes, and evaluated how using different approaches impacts estimates of stock status. Results indicate that the dynamic-BRP approach using the climate-linked natural mortality model produced the least variable reference points compared to others calculated. Summer flounder stock status depended on the estimation approach and climate model used. These results emphasize that understanding climate dependencies is important for summer flounder reference points and perhaps other species, and careful consideration is warranted when considering what time-varying approach to use, ideally based upon simulation studies within a proposed set of management procedures.},

  abstract = {Limit reference points'' define a state at which fishery management has reached overfishing, overfished stock status, or some other regulatory or conservation point of concern. In many Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. fishery jurisdictions, management only uses ``target reference points''\textemdash the specific numerical management objective intended to bring about some fishery benefit. There are several reasons to adopt limit reference points, and jurisdictions without previously defined limit reference points could adopt them in order to align better with the Magnuson\textendash Stevens Act (American fisheries) or, more importantly, to facilitate cross-jurisdiction sustainability assessments, which are increasingly needed for certifications of sustainability. In actual practice, the stock size of 0.5 times a target reference point has been used as a limit reference point for some Pacific salmon fisheries, or at least as a proxy for a limit reference point. We term this point the ``minimum stock size threshold,'' following a convention already in use, and we note that limit reference points defined this way are increasingly being accepted as a standard either because of justification based on simulation and fishery principles or for purely pragmatic reasons.},

We applied genetic tools to a unique collection of 100-year-old salmon scales to reveal declines of 56\%\textendash 99\% in wild sockeye populations across Canada's second largest salmon watershed, the Skeena River. These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

  abstract = {The ability of management strategies to achieve the fishery management goals are impacted by environmental variation and, therefore, also by global climate change. Management strategies can be modified to use environmental data using the ``dynamic B0'' concept, and changing the set of years used to define biomass reference points. Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The ``mechanistic approach'' estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the fished species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the ``empirical approach'' examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known. As such, until the skill of stock projection models improves, it seems more appropriate to consider the implications of plausible broad forecasts related to how biological parameters may change in the future as a way to assess the robustness of management strategies, rather than attempting specific predictions per se.},

Section 45.2 deals with the problem of overcapacity and resource depletion in the process of adapting fishing industries to resource limits. Section 45.3 considers " steady-state " strategies for controlling TAC and total capacity in fisheries with environmental variation. Section 45.4 deals with implications of assessment error for steady-state policies. Finally, section 45.5 discusses boundaries of models and methods and calls for balanced interdisciplinary analysis, and section 45.6 concludes.}

A changing climate will likely have differing effects on different species; some will flourish, some will flounder. Management targets for fishing mortality and spawning biomass are often calculated by assuming stationary population processes, but under climate change, this assumption may be violated. Non-stationary population processes can introduce bias into estimates of biomass from stock assessments and calculations of target fishing mortalities and biomasses. However, few accepted frameworks exist for incorporating the changing influence of the environment on exploited populations into management strategies. Identifying changes in population processes due to environmental influences is important in order to enable climate-enhanced management strategy evaluations to elucidate the potential benefits and costs of changing management targets. Cost/benefit analyses will also be useful when coincidentally caught species respond differently to environmental change.},

We compare seven methods to calculate MSY, FMSY and BMSY by modelling constant, stochastic (uncorrelated), and autocorrelated SRRs using simulations and two case studies [Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada]. Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and largemagnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and FMSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of BMSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between fishing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overfishing by going beyond FMSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable fisheries.},
