	abstract = {The document was prepared in support of an advisory process meeting to produce a technical guidance document to assist science practitioners responsible for developing the science elements of the Precautionary Approach (PA) framework. It reviews the use of reference points in the assessment and management of semelparous species and anadromous salmonids including iteroparous salmon. Semelparous species and anadromous salmonids are treated collectively and separately from other aquatic species because they share a number of life history and population dynamic characteristics which are distinct from those of other aquatic organisms. In British Columbia and Yukon, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) guides the implementation of the precautionary approach in the management of fisheries on Pacific salmon. In the WSP, biological benchmarks are developed for four main classes of indicators: trends in abundance, abundance, fishing mortality, and spawning ground distribution as data permits. These indicators are further integrated into a single category of biological status. There are no management actions which are associated directly with a given status or benchmark. Rather, the biological benchmarks aid in the development of fishery reference points along with socio-economic factors and issues related to risk tolerance. Reference points for Atlantic salmon have been used to advise fisheries management since the 1970s. The use of a conservation objective defined as a limit reference point and the fixed escapement strategy has been adopted in Canada, by national governments in Europe and by international organisations. Candidate fishery reference points and WSP benchmarks are similar to the general list of reference points proposed in a number of publications for other species. Stock and recruitment models have a long and established history in Pacific and Atlantic salmon stock assessment and provision of science advice for fisheries management. Empirical methods consisting of life history models that use life history process parameters borrowed from a large range of studies on the species of interest are considered. In data limited situations for unstudied populations but for which information exists from other populations, reference points are frequently transported based on values from studied populations which are standardized using an exchangeable and transportable metric.},

	title = {Indicators of {Status} and {Benchmarks} for {Conservation} {Units} in {Canada}'s {Wild} {Salmon} {Policy}},
	abstract = {The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).},

	abstract = {Limit reference points” deﬁne a state at which ﬁshery management has reached overﬁshing, overﬁshed stock status, or some other regulatory or conservation point of concern. In many Paciﬁc salmon Oncorhynchus spp. ﬁshery jurisdictions, management only uses “target reference points”—the speciﬁc numerical management objective intended to bring about some ﬁshery beneﬁt. There are several reasons to adopt limit reference points, and jurisdictions without previously deﬁned limit reference points could adopt them in order to align better with the Magnuson–Stevens Act (American ﬁsheries) or, more importantly, to facilitate cross-jurisdiction sustainability assessments, which are increasingly needed for certiﬁcations of sustainability. In actual practice, the stock size of 0.5 times a target reference point has been used as a limit reference point for some Paciﬁc salmon ﬁsheries, or at least as a proxy for a limit reference point. We term this point the “minimum stock size threshold,” following a convention already in use, and we note that limit reference points deﬁned this way are increasingly being accepted as a standard either because of justiﬁcation based on simulation and ﬁshery principles or for purely pragmatic reasons.},

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

Section 45.2 deals with the problem of overcapacity and resource depletion in the process of adapting fishing industries to resource limits. Section 45.3 considers " steady-state " strategies for controlling TAC and total capacity in fisheries with environmental variation. Section 45.4 deals with implications of assessment error for steady-state policies.
