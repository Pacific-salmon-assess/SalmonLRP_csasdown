# LRP Estimation Methods for Pacific Salmon {#est-methods}

This section will address the question: “What methods are available to develop SMU-level LRPs that are consistent with the WSP?”


## Estimation of CU Status

-	There are a variety of CU-level abundance based benchmarks, depending on species and data availability, etc. 
-	When providing guidance in this paper, we focus on: 

-	Stock-recruitment based benchmarks, 
-	Percentile based benchmarks, 
-	Watershed-area based benchmarks (as one example of a habitat-based benchmarks), 
-	Distributional benchmarks


-	We have not included metrics and benchmarks based on status of habitat or ecosystem status (strategies 2 and 3 of the WSP)

## Estimation of LRPs: Aggregating CU Status to the SMU-level

### Report status relative to benchmarks for individual CUs 

- i.e., no roll-up
- A benefit to no roll up is that it focuses attention directly on CUs with low status.  However, emerging policy (from NHQ) suggests that each stock should have a single established LPR (one stock = 1 LRP).

###	Ppn of CUs with status greater than red 

- Based on WSP formal integrated assessments (for CUs where data are available)
- Or approximated by abundance-based benchmarks
- if status is approximated with abundance-based benchmarks, and the status on the metric is red, this could trigger an integrated status assesment to derived a formal WSP status prior to triggering LRP.

### Multidimensional approach to aggregating metrics within CUs 

- Algorithm to approximate "integrated" status has been developed by the State of the Salmon program, and can be applied to LRP estimation
- Valuable when abundance-based benchmark (e.g., Sgen) cannot be calculated and percentile-based benchmarks are not reliable (productivity low or HR high)
- NB the algorithm defaults to abundance-based benchmarks when they are available
- As above,  if status is approximated with the algorithm and the status on the metric is red, this could trigger an integrated status assessment to derive a formal WSP status prior to triggering LRP.
- It may be possible to extend this approach in the future to account for ecosystem components of serious harm and divergent levels of data quantity and quality among CUs. 
- This approach could also be extended to management triggers that occur prior to LRP, e.g.., that require precautionary management and/or more monitoring 



### Aggregate Abundance LRPs Derived from Empirical Data (Empircally-based LRPs)

- Description of logistic model approach, with illustrative figures, equations, etc
-	Data-based LRPs require a single, measurable benchmark that can be used to quantify CU-status as being healthy (above the benchmark) or not healthy (below the benchmark). This benchmark should be consistent with the definition of a CU in the red zone under the WSP. 
-	Describe suggested model validation/checks for logistic regression and illustrate on an example SMU.
-	Describe approaches for estimating uncertainty: e.g., Integrated modelling approaches and Combining projections from multiple models used to estimate Sgen

### Aggregate Abundance LRPs Derived from Projections (Projection-based LRPs)

-	Description of projected LRP approach, with illustrative figures, equations, etc
-	Reference to previously published samSim reports / papers, as well as GitHub repo with updated code
-	Develop LRPs from projections at specific proportions instead of logistic regression
-	Note that all of the benchmarks provided in Table 1 can all be used as a basis for defining prospective LRPs 
-	Describe approaches for estimating uncertainty, e.g., Combining projections from multiple operating model scenarios


### Aggregate abundance not directly tied to CU status

- There may be cases where work has been done to identify SMU-level limit reference points that are not directly linked to CU status. For example methods developed to support PST management.

- If we rely on aggregate abundances (or indicators within an SMU) determined via other approaches, can we justify it because of evidence that CUs co-vary, e.g.,	they have similar threats, e.g., 
- fisheries are sampled for GSI and proportions have not changed over time suggesting that smaller CUs are not being over harvested
- available escapement data suggests CUs are stable,
- evidence of covariance in spawner time-series (or productivity time-series where available)

## Considerations When Selecting a LRP Estimation Method

- Decision tree for which LRP to use
- With discussion of the advantages and challenges of each approach.  
- maybe move to Section 4
