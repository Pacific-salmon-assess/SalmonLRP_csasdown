# LRP Estimation Methods for Pacific Salmon {#est-methods}


<!--CH:  ask Julie and Danny Ings for advice on making these principles and LRPs as consistent as possible with NHQ guidance -->

Here we outline principles for developing LRPs for Pacific salmon, adapted from those developed for national-level guidance on LRPs (Marentette et al. in prep). That guidance allows for flexibility in the development of LRPs to respect differences in species contexts and data types, quantities, and qualities, and is not meant to be prescriptive. By following similar principles, Pacific salmon LRPs will be aligned with national direction while accounting for unique characteristics of salmon species and data. 

**Principle 1**. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm to the stock, as described in @dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009, and Section \@ref(intro). The LRP should be set above where serious harm is occurring, and should avoid long-term losses, such as those associated with fishing and ecosystem components. 

**Principle 2**. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the stock. Criteria for evaluating best scientific information developed for US National Standards may be applicable here for identifying best available information for LRPs [@USCodeFederal2021]. These criteria are: relevance, inclusiveness, objectivity, transparency and openness, timeliness, verification and validation, and peer review [@USCodeFederal2021].  In addition, scientific information should include an evaluation of uncertainties and identify gaps in our understanding or information. When uncertainty arises from multiple LRPs or from various assumptions within a single LRP, these should be acknowledged and considered when providing LRP recommendations. Where weigth-of-evidence supports a set of assumptions or hypotheses associated with one LRP, then this LRP can be recommended. Where evidence is inconclusive, this uncertainty should be integrated into stock assessment and clearly communicated.

Within this principle, it is recognized that science is not static and new findings continually advance our understanding of best available information. In particular, peer-review is necessary to ensure that the quality and credibility of data and methods for LRP development meet the standards of the scientific community. When determining whether to conduct a peer review, the level of novelty and complexity, and any previous reviews should be considered. Although routine updates may not need formal peer review, new LRPS or the application of benchmarks and LRPs to new CUs and SMUs assessments may require peer review.  

Similarly, best practices, or practices that have been demonstrated to work well can be used to inform reference points, as defined by @sainsburyBestPracticeReference2008. "The ‘best practice’ concept is based on the best practice that has been demonstrated through use, and recognizes that views of what is ‘best’ will continuously improve with experience. Best practice is not an absolute or fixed entity, or a guarantee of adequacy. It is based on experience to date and it is expected to evolve over time." [@sainsburyBestPracticeReference2008]


**Principle 3**. LRPs should be operational. They should be feasible to calculate based on data that are available and relevant to the policy context and management of the stock. Data availability varies widely among CUs and SMUs, requiring a variety of approaches for CU and SMU-level assessments. No one method will be operational across all cases. To be operational, LRPs should also be easy to communicate to managers and stakeholders in a way that can be understood and used to inform decisions.

**Principle 4**. LRPs should be reliably estimated. In other words, to the extend possible LRPs should capture underlying true levels of serious harm instead of noise or observation errors. Reliable estimation will depend on the quality and frequency of data collection and the evidence to support underlying relationships and population dynamics used to derive LRPs. Where there is coherence in LRP estimates among analytical methods, this brings additional reliability to the LRP recommendation.

<!--RE: pgh below
CW: 'statistically integrated' or sequential Bayes? i.e. sampling from posterior. 
CH: I think the point of Staton et al. 2017 is that for salmon, statistical integration wasn't always essential and the standard sequential approach may be sufficient in many cases (though underestimating uncertainty). I don't think they necessarily recommended Bayes over frequentest. For the watershed-area model, I used TMB, but draw random draws from 95%CI of SREP to get uncertainties in benchmarks. We used TMB to minimize estimation time as we thought we would be running simulation evaluations.  So, I'd prefer not to include recommendation on Bayes vs Freq analyses. However, instead of recommending integrated analyses always,  we could recommend that it be considered--> 

Where possible, a statistically integrated approach for estimating LRPs should be considered in order to propagate uncertainties throughout analyses and to be consistent with current best practices in fisheries stock assessments [@puntEssentialFeaturesNextgeneration2020a]. @statonSequentialIntegratedBayesian2017a and @defilippoImprovingShorttermRecruitment2021 provide recent examples of integrated models used for salmon assessments. Both studies show that uncertainty propagation increases realism of model estimates and associated uncertainty. However, @statonSequentialIntegratedBayesian2017a demonstrated that similar point estimates of current status can be achieved by using sequential estimation approaches and the benefits of statistically integrated approaches may not be large enough to warrant an integrated analysis in all cases. 

**Principle 5**.  In addition to principles derived for marine fish species in general (Principles 1-4), for Pacific salmon, LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the WSP. The WSP framework for defining biological units and assessing their status along biological metrics with lower benchmarks to avoid risks of extinction is consistent with avoiding serious harm to the CU. Above the lower benchmarks (above red status), irreversible or slowly reversible impacts are avoided.  Ignoring CU-level status can result in serial depletion (or loss) of weak component CUs within an SMU, resulting in a possibly misleading indication of serious harm and status. Therefore, to be consistent with the WSP, LRPs should consider status of component CUs.

For marine fish species LRPs are typically estimated as a minimum level of spawning biomass that should not be breached (Kronlund et al. 2018), LRPs that consider the distribution of abundances among component CUs and alternative metrics of status within CUs such as trends in abundances and distribution of spawning are considered here to be consistent with previous status assessments under the WSP. Furthermore, DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework identifies additional metrics such as catch rate indices, size and age profiles, and sex ratios that "can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition” [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. Our goal is to provide overall guidelines on LRP development while providing flexibility in application of these methods due to differences in local biological characteristics, data qualities and data quantities, among other factors. Alternative LRPs aligned with the key principles above may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality, and types, and dimensions of biological status.




<!-- Julie Marentette: There’s actually a list of 8 draft criteria/principles (supported by a number of sub-principles) we are working with right now for WP1; we only carried the first 4 into this workshop and exercises for a few reasons (because 8 is a lot, and the latter 4 are rather more to do with best practices for actions as opposed to outright characteristics or descriptors of the LRPs and indicators).

Principle 1: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be consistent with an objective to avoid serious harm to the stock.
Principle 2: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the stock. The US link for best available information was this one: see pt. 6 https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-600/subpart-D/section-600.315
Principle 3: Stock status, indicators and LRPs should be operational (feasible and relevant to the management of the stock).
-CH  note: tractable to calculate, easy to communicate
Principle 4: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be reliably estimable.
-CH notes: data quality and frequency of collection; is SR sound basis for LRP; weight of evidence among different options, coherence in methods; looking for ways to account for uncertainty
Principle 5: When selecting from multiple alternatives, the choice of stock status indicators and LRPs should take into account risk.
Principle 6: If all else fails, consider the use of alternative paradigms.
Principle 7: Consider whether reference points or indicators should be changed.
Principle 8: Clearly communicate advice on stock status and reference points.

Our intention is to describe approaches for deriving CU status applicable over a range of data qualities and types, and provide LRPs that integrate the CU-level information to the scale of SMUs.  Below methods for estimating CU status are described, as implemented in previous status assessments under the WSP. Then candidate LRPs that integrate CU statuses are briefly described falling into two categories: those based on the proportion of component CUs above the red zone and those based on aggregate abundances.  A more detailed description of LRPs with technical details is included Working Paper 2. Guidelines on how to choose among LRPs is described in Section \@ref(guidelines). 


## Estimation of CU Status {#cu-est-methods}


To be consistent with the multidimensional approach to WSP status assessments described in @holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009a, we recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated through expert-driven processes or the through the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool (Pestal et al. in prep.), where possible.  This approach allows for the assessment of status across a wide range of data availability; when data for a single metric is not available other metrics can be used to inform status. Although the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool can provide provisional assessments under data limitations, uncertainties resulting from data limitations are not currently integrated into the provision of recommended status. Ongoing improvements to the tool will consider those uncertainties.  


One metric within the multidimensional approach is spawner abundances relative to <!--CH: "estimated" to distinguish for SoS's absolute or non-estimated benchmarks--> abundance-based benchmarks. Various types of benchmarks have been identified along this metric to account for differences in data types, quantities and qualities among CUs. For data-rich CUs where spawner-recruitment relationships can be reliably estimated, the abundance resulting in recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, $S_{gen}$ is recommended by @holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009. Where recruitment time-series are not available and productivity is assumed to be moderate or high and harvest rates moderate or low, specified percentiles of observed spawner time-series, (e.g., 25th) can be used as a proxy for spawner-recruitment benchmarks [@holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. For Chinook and Coho Salmon where production is often limited by the quantity of freshwater habitat, equilibrium spawner abundances can be predicted from habitat characteristics to inform abundance-based benchmarks [@nobleHabitatbasedEscapementBenchmarks2015; @parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006]. For example, @parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006 use the relationship between watershed area and spawner-recruitment based reference points in a meta-analysis of Chinook Salmon stocks across the Pacific region to predict reference points for Chinook stocks without recruitment data.

In addition, metrics on the distribution of spawning within a CU can be considered in WSP assessments [@peacockReviewMetricsDistribution2010a; peacockMetricsSamplingDesigns2012]. Although benchmarks along metrics of distribution have not been identified for WSP assessment, for Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, short and long-term recovery targets along a metric of spawning distribution among sub-populations was identified [@ifcrtinteriorfrasercohorecoveryteamConservationStrategyCoho2006], and forms a basis for management of this SMU.

The metrics and benchmarks described above are a subset of those considered within Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool (which also include short and long-term trends over time, and abundances relative to absolute conservation threshold). For the purposes of LRP development, individual metrics on spawner abundances are applied both within the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool and independently of the Tool to demonstrate the consistency (and occasional inconsistency) with status on multidimensional vs single-metric approaches. When only a single metric is applied to derive status, there is a risk of providing a misleading assessment if overall status is informed from additional metrics which diverge from abundance-based metrics but are not considered.

When assessing CU status relative to abundance-based lower benchmarks, we use generational mean spawner abundances as a basis for determining whether each CU is above or below its lower benchmark. Generational smoothing integrates status over cohorts within a generation, which are tend to exhibit relatively independent dynamics. This approach reduces noise in annual CU status determination due to annual fluctuations in CU abundances from any single cohort. It also makes our determination of CU status consistent with the approach taken for abundance-based benchmarks in WSP assessments and the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool.

## Estimation of LRPs: Aggregating CU benchmarks and status to the SMU-level

<!--CH suggest removing:
### Report status relative to benchmarks for individual CUs
- i.e., no roll-up
- A benefit to no roll up is that it focuses attention directly on CUs with low status.  However, emerging policy (from NHQ) suggests that each stock should have a single established LPR (one stock = 1 LRP).
-->
### Proportion-based LRPs

Proportion-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above the red WSP status zone. To be consistent with the intent of the WSP of preserving biodiversity at the CU-level, we identify an LRP at 100% of CUs having status estimates above red (i.e., either amber or green). When any individual CU falls into the red zone, then the LRP is considered breached. See section \@ref(guidelines) for a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs that further considers data limitations when identifying the proportion of CUs above the red zone. CU statuses are derived using the approaches described in Section \@ref(cu-est-methods).

** Add the extent to which this meets 5 principles

### Logistic regression-based LRPs{#logisticMethods}

We considered two LRPs based on aggregate-abundances of the SMU that rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses of component CUs, logistic-regression based LRPs and projection-based LRPs (\@ref(projectedMethods)). The reliability of aggregate-abundance based LRPs and their ability to avoid serious harm at the CU level depends on the strength of that underlying relationship as exhibited in observed data. These two LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the aggregate abundances associated with a desired probability of all CUs achieving status above the red zone. To some extent uncertainty in the underlying relationship between observed aggregate abundances and CU-level statuses is captured in the probabilistic nature of these LRPs; larger uncertainties results in higher LRP values and vice versa, with all else remaining equal. <!--CH comment. This last sentence might be too much information at the beginning of the section? though the 2nd sentence of this pgh could misleading without this caveat. Could consider moving...?--> 


Logistic regression-based LRPs are derived from an empirically estimated relationship between CU-level statuses and aggregate SMU abundance. This method for deriving LRPs extends proportion-based LRPs by identifying the aggregate abundance level that has historically been associated with a given probability of 100% of CUs having status above the red zone, as approximated from status on a single metric of spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. For each year of observed data, CU-level status is quantified as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have estimated status greater than the lower benchmark and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have status greater than the lower benchmark, or a least one CU was assessed below the lower benchmark. A logistic regression is then fit to these outcomes to estimate the probability that all CUs will have statuses greater than red as a function of aggregate SMU spawner abundances. The following logistic regression equation is used to estimate LRPs,

\begin{equation}
  \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = B_0 + B_1 \sum_{i}^{i=nCUs} S_{i,t}
   (\#eq:logistic)
\end{equation}

where, $p$ is probability, $B_0$ and $B_1$ are estimated logistic regression parameters and $S_{i,t}$ is spawner abundance to CU $i$ in year $t$. Equation \@ref(eq:logistic) is then re-arranged to calculate the LRP as the aggregate spawner abundance associated with the pre-specified probability threshold of $p^*$,

\begin{equation}
  LRP = \frac{log(\frac{p^*}{1-p^*}) - B_0}{B_1}
  (\#eq:logisticLRP)
\end{equation}

An example logistic regression fit is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:example-logisticFit), with LRPs associated with four probability thresholds, 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, 0.99. Uncertainty in LRP estimates were quantified based on a 95% confidence interval on the maximum likelihood estimate, MLE.

```

We recommend evaluating the fit of the logistic regression prior to the development of LRPs to identify its reliability in determining serious harm to component CUs. Diagnostics commonly used for logistic regression of Bernoulli distributed data are provided in Holt et al. (in prep.), for example, evaluating the assumptions that the aggregate abundances is linearly related to log-odds of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, observations are independent, and there are no influential outliers. In addition, the statistical significance of the predictor variable, aggregate abundances and the goodness-of-fit of the logistic model can inform its reliability for determining LRPs. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of LRPs developed from a logistic regression can be evaluated on the observed data using the performance metric, hit ratio. This ratio represents the proportion of successful classifications above or below the logistic-regression derived LRP, relative to the total number classifications or years.  Out-of-sample cross-validation methods can be applied so that model-based LRPs do not include the observed data used for evaluation in this performance metric.

We applied a single metric on spawner abundances to approximate CU-status because multidimensional approaches for WSP assessments include  generational smoothing of spawner abundance and metrics of temporal trends, which introduces autocorrelation in observed CU statuses, violating an assumption of the logistic regression model. Future research could consider logistic-regression models that include autocorrelated residuals to develop LRPs based on CU-statuses provided from the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool.

Using a single-metric proxy for CU status also allowed us to use a statistically integrated estimation approach, where CU-level stock-recruitment models and associated CU-level benchmarks were estimated in the same model as the logistic regression and LRP derivation. In this way, the uncertainty from CU-level assessments can be propogated to the development of the LRP and the assessment against that LRP. The model provides the probability of being below the LRP in the current year that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in CU-level assessments against their lower benchmarks.  

Furthermore, structural uncertainty in underlying assumptions about the basis of CU-level benchmarks, such as spawner-recruitment relationship can be addressed in at least three ways that are not mutually exclusive. First, the weight of evidence for various assumptions can be identified to identify the assumptions with the most support for underlying CU dynamics and CU status, which is then used for LRP development. Second, various assumptions can be provided as sensitivity analyses demonstrating the impact of assumptions about CU dynamics on LRPs estimates and current status, if possible with a narrative describing which is considered a base case. Third, LRPs can be averaged by, for example, combining posterior probability estimates. When averaging, LRPs can be weighted according to strength of evidence for each hypothesis based on statistical criteria (e.g., AIC), retrospective performance, or expert opinion [@rossiInferringFisheriesStock2019; @jardimOperationalizingEnsembleModels2021].

<!--CH to add--> Add the extent to which this meets 5 principles, and caveats about use of historical data Also, it is not possible to assess sensitivity of LRPs to  structural assumptions about covariance in population dyanmics among CU and the relationship between aggregate abundances and CU statuses, as the LRP depends only on the logistic fit to observed data.(but also repeated in uncertainties section in last chapter). 

### Projection-based LRPs {#projectedMethods}

Similar to logistic-regression based LRPs, projection-based LRPs rely on an underlying relationship between aggregate-abundances and status of component CUs. However, unlike logistic-regression based LRPs, the impacts of structural assumptions about the different structural assumptions about covariance among CUs and the resulting relationship between aggregate abundances and CU statuses can be evaluated. 

The projection-based LRP approach uses population parameters of individual CUs within an SMU to project abundances forward with natural variability in recruitment and ages-at-maturity under current exploitation rates characterized with annual implementation uncertainty. Projections are run for 30 years after an initialization period to remove the impacts of initial conditions and identify aggregate abundances characterized by an equilibrium state represented by stable distribution of projected abundances. Projection-based LRPs are then estimated using these projected CU abundances to characterize the relationship between aggregate SMU-level spawner abundance and the probability that all CUs will be above their lower benchmarks (e.g. $S_{gen}$). As for logistic regression-based LRPs, we relied on status estimated from a single metric rather than the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool because the projection is meant to capture equilibrium conditions and is not appropriate for identifying status on temporal trends includes as metrics in the Tool.

One advantage of approach for projection-based LRPs is that it allows for explicit consideration of uncertainty in underlying assumptions about model parameters, structure and the covariance among CUs in population dynamics, by including those characteristics as random or uncertain components of the projections.  To implement projection-based LRPs, we adapted a previously developed R package for performing closed-loop simulation modelling, samSim [@holtQuantitativeToolEvaluating2020; @freshwaterBenefitsLimitationsIncreasing2020], as described in Appendix to Holt et al. (in prep) and documented online \@ref(app:first-appendix).

### Simple Aggregate Abundance LRPs
- There may be cases where SMU-level limit reference points may be based on analyses on the aggregate abundances, without defining finer spatial scales
= For example, for SMUs containing only one CU, LRP can be defined as the lower biological benchmark for the CU. 

- Although it may be possible to estimate LRPs based on aggregate data for SMUs that contains multiple CUs with very high covariance, in practice, natural variability in population dynamics among CUs within SMUs is generally high enough such that risks of CUS being depleted below lower benchmarks with this approach are not negligible (i.e., above acceptable levels). 
- This approach should only be considered in exceptional circumstances when there is evidence for high covariance in dynamics among CUs within and SMU and risks of individual CUs being depleted below lower benchmarks has been evaluated, e.g., through simulation evaluation. 

Evidence for covariation in CU-level dynamics can be derived from fisheries that are sampled for GSI, i.e., CU-proportions have not changed over time suggesting that smaller CUs are not being over harvested
- Also, available escapement data suggests CUs are stable,
- evidence of covariance in spawner time-series (or productivity time-series where available), >>0.5?


## Considerations When Selecting a LRP Estimation Method

- We propose a step-wise approach for identifying status relative to LRPs, which is based on the proportion of CUs status greater than red under the Wild Salmon Policy. 
- This LRP is recommended as the default for evaluating status under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act for Pacific Salmon, with additional aggregate-abundance based LRPs developed as required for local or international management and are supplemental.
- This stepwise approach is described in more detail in section \@ref(guidelines).
