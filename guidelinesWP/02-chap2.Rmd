# LRP Estimation Methods for Pacific Salmon {#est-methods}


<!--CH:  ask Julie and Danny Ings for advice on making these principles and LRPs as consistent as possible with NHQ guidance -->

Here we outline principles for developing LRPs for Pacific salmon, adapted from those developed for national-level guidance on LRPs (Marentette et al. in prep). That guidance allows for flexibility in the development of LRPs to respect differences in species contexts and data types, quantities, and qualities, and is not meant to be prescriptive. By following similar principles, Pacific salmon LRPs will be aligned with national direction while accounting for unique characteristics of salmon species and data. 

**Principle 1**. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm to the stock, as described in @dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009, and Section \@ref(intro). The LRP should be set above where serious harm is occurring, and should avoid long-term losses, such as those associated with fishing and ecosystem components. 

**Principle 2**. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the stock. Criteria for evaluating best scientific information developed for US National Standards may be applicable here for identifying best available information for LRPs [@USCodeFederal2021]. These criteria are: relevance, inclusiveness, objectivity, transparency and openness, timeliness, verification and validation, and peer review [@USCodeFederal2021].  In addition, scientific information should include an evaluation of uncertainties and identify gaps in our understanding or information. When uncertainty arises from multiple LRPs or from various assumptions within a single LRP, these should be acknowledged and considered when providing LRP recommendations. Where weigth-of-evidence supports a set of assumptions or hypotheses associated with one LRP, then this LRP can be recommended. Where evidence is inconclusive, this uncertainty should be integrated into stock assessment and clearly communicated.

Within this principle, it is recognized that science is not static and new findings continually advance our understanding of best available information. In particular, peer-review is necessary to ensure that the quality and credibility of data and methods for LRP development meet the standards of the scientific community. When determining whether to conduct a peer review, the level of novelty and complexity, and any previous reviews should be considered. Although routine updates may not need formal peer review, new LRPS or the application of benchmarks and LRPs to new CUs and SMUs assessments may require peer review.  

Similarly, best practices, or practices that have been demonstrated to work well can be used to inform reference points, as defined by @sainsburyBestPracticeReference2008. "The ‘best practice’ concept is based on the best practice that has been demonstrated through use, and recognizes that views of what is ‘best’ will continuously improve with experience. Best practice is not an absolute or fixed entity, or a guarantee of adequacy. It is based on experience to date and it is expected to evolve over time." [@sainsburyBestPracticeReference2008]


**Principle 3**. LRPs should be operational. They should be feasible to calculate based on data that are available and relevant to the policy context and management of the stock. Data availability varies widely among CUs and SMUs, requiring a variety of approaches for CU and SMU-level assessments. No one method will be operational across all cases. To be operational, LRPs should also be easy to communicate to managers and stakeholders in a way that can be understood and used to inform decisions.

**Principle 4**. LRPs should be reliably estimated. In other words, to the extend possible LRPs should capture underlying true levels of serious harm instead of noise or observation errors. Reliable estimation will depend on the quality and frequency of data collection and the evidence to support underlying relationships and population dynamics used to derive LRPs. Where there is coherence in LRP estimates among analytical methods, this brings additional reliability to the LRP recommendation.

<!--RE: pgh below
CW: 'statistically integrated' or sequential Bayes? i.e. sampling from posterior. 
CH: I think the point of Staton et al. 2017 is that for salmon, statistical integration wasn't always essential and the standard sequential approach may be sufficient in many cases (though underestimating uncertainty). I don't think they necessarily recommended Bayes over frequentest. For the watershed-area model, I used TMB, but draw random draws from 95%CI of SREP to get uncertainties in benchmarks. We used TMB to minimize estimation time as we thought we would be running simulation evaluations.  So, I'd prefer not to include recommendation on Bayes vs Freq analyses. However, instead of recommending integrated analyses always,  we could recommend that it be considered--> 

Where possible, a statistically integrated approach for estimating LRPs should be considered in order to propagate uncertainties throughout analyses and to be consistent with current best practices in fisheries stock assessments [@puntEssentialFeaturesNextgeneration2020a]. @statonSequentialIntegratedBayesian2017a and @defilippoImprovingShorttermRecruitment2021 provide recent examples of integrated models used for salmon assessments. Both studies show that uncertainty propagation increases realism of model estimates and associated uncertainty. However, @statonSequentialIntegratedBayesian2017a demonstrated that similar point estimates of current status can be achieved by using sequential estimation approaches and the benefits of statistically integrated approaches may not be large enough to warrant an integrated analysis in all cases. 

**Principle 5**.  In addition to principles derived for marine fish species in general (Principles 1-4), for Pacific salmon, LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the WSP. The WSP framework for defining biological units and assessing their status along biological metrics with lower benchmarks to avoid risks of extinction is consistent with avoiding serious harm to the CU. Above the lower benchmarks (above red status), irreversible or slowly reversible impacts are avoided.  Ignoring CU-level status can result in serial depletion (or loss) of weak component CUs within an SMU, resulting in a possibly misleading indication of serious harm and status. Therefore, to be consistent with the WSP, LRPs should consider status of component CUs.

For marine fish species LRPs are typically estimated as a minimum level of spawning biomass that should not be breached (Kronlund et al. 2018), LRPs that consider the distribution of abundances among component CUs and alternative metrics of status within CUs such as trends in abundances and distribution of spawning are considered here to be consistent with previous status assessments under the WSP. Furthermore, DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework identifies additional metrics such as catch rate indices, size and age profiles, and sex ratios that "can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition” [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. Our goal is to provide overall guidelines on LRP development while providing flexibility in application of these methods due to differences in local biological characteristics, data qualities and data quantities, among other factors. Alternative LRPs aligned with the key principles above may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality, and types, and dimensions of biological status.




<!-- Julie Marentette: There’s actually a list of 8 draft criteria/principles (supported by a number of sub-principles) we are working with right now for WP1; we only carried the first 4 into this workshop and exercises for a few reasons (because 8 is a lot, and the latter 4 are rather more to do with best practices for actions as opposed to outright characteristics or descriptors of the LRPs and indicators).

Principle 1: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be consistent with an objective to avoid serious harm to the stock.
Principle 2: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the stock. The US link for best available information was this one: see pt. 6 https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-600/subpart-D/section-600.315
Principle 3: Stock status, indicators and LRPs should be operational (feasible and relevant to the management of the stock).
-CH  note: tractable to calculate, easy to communicate
Principle 4: Stock status indicators and LRPs should be reliably estimable.
-CH notes: data quality and frequency of collection; is SR sound basis for LRP; weight of evidence among different options, coherence in methods; looking for ways to account for uncertainty
Principle 5: When selecting from multiple alternatives, the choice of stock status indicators and LRPs should take into account risk.
Principle 6: If all else fails, consider the use of alternative paradigms.
Principle 7: Consider whether reference points or indicators should be changed.
Principle 8: Clearly communicate advice on stock status and reference points.

Our intention is to describe approaches for deriving CU status applicable over a range of data qualities and types, and provide LRPs that integrate the CU-level information to the scale of SMUs.  Below methods for estimating CU status are described, as implemented in previous status assessments under the WSP. Then candidate LRPs that integrate CU statuses are briefly described falling into two categories: those based on the proportion of component CUs above the red zone and those based on aggregate abundances.  A more detailed description of LRPs with technical details is included Working Paper 2. Guidelines on how to choose among LRPs is described in Section \@ref(guidelines). 


## Estimation of CU Status


-	There are a variety of CU-level abundance based benchmarks, depending on species and data availability, etc. 
-	When providing guidance in this paper, we focus on: 

-	Stock-recruitment based benchmarks, 
-	Percentile based benchmarks, 
-	Watershed-area based benchmarks (as one example of a habitat-based benchmarks), 
-	Distributional benchmarks


-	We have not included metrics and benchmarks based on status of habitat or ecosystem status (strategies 2 and 3 of the WSP)
- future work could further considere allee effects realtive to lower benchmarks


## Estimation of LRPs: Aggregating CU Status to the SMU-level

### Report status relative to benchmarks for individual CUs

- i.e., no roll-up
- A benefit to no roll up is that it focuses attention directly on CUs with low status.  However, emerging policy (from NHQ) suggests that each stock should have a single established LPR (one stock = 1 LRP).

### Ppn of CUs with status greater than red

- Based on WSP formal integrated assessments (for CUs where data are available)
- Or approximated by abundance-based benchmarks
- if status is approximated with abundance-based benchmarks, and the status on the metric is red, this could trigger an integrated status assesment to derived a formal WSP status prior to triggering LRP.

### Multidimensional approach to aggregating metrics within CUs

- Algorithm to approximate "integrated" status has been developed by the State of the Salmon program, and can be applied to LRP estimation
- Valuable when abundance-based benchmark (e.g., Sgen) cannot be calculated and percentile-based benchmarks are not reliable (productivity low or HR high)
- NB the algorithm defaults to abundance-based benchmarks when they are available
- As above,  if status is approximated with the algorithm and the status on the metric is red, this could trigger an integrated status assessment to derive a formal WSP status prior to triggering LRP.
- It may be possible to extend this approach in the future to account for ecosystem components of serious harm and divergent levels of data quantity and quality among CUs. 
- This approach could also be extended to management triggers that occur prior to LRP, e.g.., that require precautionary management and/or more monitoring 



### Aggregate Abundance LRPs Derived from Empirical Data (Empircally-based LRPs)

<!-- K.Holt: the following text has been moved here from the chum chapter of the case study paper.
"The goal of these methods was to explore whether the status of component CUs could be predicted well by the aggregate abundance of the whole SMU. The motivation behind this approach is that many SMUs are not monitored at the CU level. If the aggregate abundance of the SMU could predict the status of component CUs, then an LRP that is measured in aggregate SMU abundance could be reliably used." 

--- also of note: abundance-based benchmarks may be preferred for link to HCR

--> 

- Description of logistic model approach, with illustrative figures, equations, etc
-	Data-based LRPs require a single, measurable benchmark that can be used to quantify CU-status as being healthy (above the benchmark) or not healthy (below the benchmark). This benchmark should be consistent with the definition of a CU in the red zone under the WSP. 
-	Describe suggested model validation/checks for logistic regression and illustrate on an example SMU.
-	Describe approaches for estimating uncertainty: e.g., Integrated modelling approaches and Combining projections from multiple models used to estimate Sgen

### Aggregate Abundance LRPs Derived from Projections (Projection-based LRPs)
- equilibrium approach that identifies emergent properties of the aggregate given assumptions about underlying population dynamics.
-	Description of projected LRP approach, with illustrative figures, equations, etc
-	Reference to previously published samSim reports / papers, as well as GitHub repo with updated code
-	Develop LRPs from projections at specific proportions instead of logistic regression
-	Note that all of the benchmarks provided in Table 1 can all be used as a basis for defining prospective LRPs 
-	Describe approaches for estimating uncertainty, e.g., Combining projections from multiple operating model scenarios


### Simple Aggregate Abundance LRPs

<!-- CW: What exactly is this approach? Just summing the lower benchmarks of all CUs? Or adding all the SR time series and estimating a single Sgen? Or something else? -->

- There may be cases where SMU-level limit reference points may be based on analyses on the aggregate abundances, without defining finer spatial scales
= For example, for SMUs containing only one CU, LRP can be defined as the lower biological benchmark for the CU. 

- Although it may be possible to estimate LRPs based on aggregate data for SMUs that contains multiple CUs with very high covariance, in practice, natural variability in population dynamics among CUs within SMUs is generally high enough such that risks of CUS being depleted below lower benchmarks with this approach are not negligible (i.e., above acceptable levels). 
- This approach should only be considered in exceptional circumstances when there is evidence for high covariance in dynamics among CUs within and SMU and risks of individual CUs being depleted below lower benchmarks has been evaluated, e.g., through simulation evaluation. 

Evidence for covariation in CU-level dynamics can be derived from fisheries that are sampled for GSI, i.e., CU-proportions have not changed over time suggesting that smaller CUs are not being over harvested
- Also, available escapement data suggests CUs are stable,
- evidence of covariance in spawner time-series (or productivity time-series where available), >>0.5?

## Considerations When Selecting a LRP Estimation Method

- We propose a step-wise approach for identifying status relative to LRPs, which is based on the proportion of CUs status greater than red under the Wild Salmon Policy. 
- This LRP is recommended as the default for evaluating status under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act for Pacific Salmon, with additional aggregate-abundance based LRPs developed as required for local or international management and are supplemental.
- This stepwise approach is described in more detail in section \@ref(guidelines).
