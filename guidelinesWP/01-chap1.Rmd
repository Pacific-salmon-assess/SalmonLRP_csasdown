# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background & Motivation for Project
- Revised Fisheries Act received Royal Assent in June 2019.  
-	Changes to the Act include fish stocks provisions that introduce legal requirements to promote sustainability, avoid Limit Reference Points (LRPs) and implement rebuilding plans for depleted stocks.
-	Under these fish stock provisions, LRPs that represent the level below which serious harm is occurring will be required for major fish stocks prescribed in regulation.  LRPs define the trigger below which rebuilding plans will be required. 
-	Definition of a LRP under SFF, mentioning impacts on ecosystem, such as dependent species (see Pacific herring CSAS for an example), Fisheries Act, etc
-	“The choice of LRP needs to be feasible (separate from, but can be operationalized by, appropriate management measures), defensible (consistent with best practices), reliably estimated, and in line with the intent of the Precautionary Approach Policy regarding serious harm (DFO 2009).“ (DFO NHQ) 

Scales of Pacific salmon assessment reporting

1. Wild Salmon Policy
2. COSEWIC
3. Pacific Salmon Treaty Management Units
4. SMUs intended to represent “major fish stocks”, which the fish stock provisions in the new Fisheries Act will be applied to.  The proposed functional definition of an SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. Note to readers, we are not reviewing SMUs in this document. Include consequences of using SMUs not aligned with CUs (i.e,  could lose component CUs if managing only to the aggregate SMU without considering of CU-level diversity)

-	Establish that LRPs for salmon should be consistent with the WSP
-	Unique characteristics of Pacific salmon data and assessment: e.g., diverse data available on various characteristics of population dynamics,	Multiple metrics and benchmarks are available that reflect this diversity
-	Project Goal: Provide analysts and managers with methodological tools and guidance to identify LRPs for SMUs.   Having guidelines that have been reviewed and published through CSAS will provide a scientific basis for individual applications of the methodology throughout the Pacific Region in consultation with Indigenous groups and stakeholders, and ensure consistency in application.

## R MARKDOWN BASICS {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using _R Markdown_. _Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. _R Markdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.  For more details on using _R Markdown_ see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

## LISTS

CSAS allows ordered lists:

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

and bulleted lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2

Notice in the ordered list that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4.  _Markdown_ automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create sublists, just indent the values a bit (at least three spaces) and make sure there are no newlines between the items. (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   a. Item 3a
   a. Item 3b
      i. Item 3bi
      i. Item 3bii
      i. Item 3biii
      i. Item 3biv
      i. Item 3bv
         1. Item 3bv1
         1. Item 3bv2

## LINE BREAKS

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:*

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R CHUNKS

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## INLINE CODE

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`.

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].

## INCLUDING PLOTS

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.

Another useful chunk option is the setting of `cache=TRUE` as you see here.  If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations or plots that are expensive to generate you can use knitr caching to improve performance.  Later in this file, you'll see a way to reference plots created in **R** or external figures.

## LOADING AND EXPLORING DATA

Included in this template is a file called `flights.csv`.  This file includes a subset of the larger dataset of information about all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014.  More information about this dataset and its **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>.  This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values.  Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

\  

We can load in this data set using the following command (`read_csv()` is from the package `readr`):
```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
flights <- read_csv(file.path("data", "flights.csv"))
```  

\  

*Before we continue, note that to insert extra blank lines in text as we did above and below, we need to have a line with a backslash followed by two spaces. Look carefully at those lines in the code editor.*

\  

All your tabular data should be in `.csv` files and placed in the `data` directory. The function `here::here()` should always be used when loading data into the project because it will prepend the full root directory of the project onto the directories and files inside the call. This gives consistent file structure access across multiple machines and platforms.

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**.  To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions.  Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.

```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```
\  

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form.  With this dataset having more than 50,000 rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command here.  I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have run the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**. To do that, you can use the command `View(flights)`.

A simple and effective way to see the entire structure in one call is to use the `glimpse()` command like this:
```{r glimpse_flights, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(flights)
```

```{r view_flights, eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed.  It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations.  Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information about the Portland flights in 2014.  You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful, high-quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# List of packages required for this analysis
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "bookdown", "devtools")
# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg)) {
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}
library(csasdown)
```

\clearpage

The example we show here does the following:

- Selects only the `carrier_name` and `arr_delay` from the `flights` dataset and then assigns this subset to a new variable called `flights2`.

- Using `flights2`, we determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

```{r max_delays}
library(dplyr)
flights2 <- flights %>%
  select(carrier_name, arr_delay)
max_delays <- flights2 %>%
  group_by(carrier_name) %>%
  summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

A useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in _R Markdown_ is called `kable`.  It is much easier to use than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting values into Excel or LaTeX.  This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be! (Note the use of `results="asis"`, which will produce the table instead of the code to create the table.)  The `caption.short` argument is used to include a shorter title to appear in the List of Tables.

Within CSAS you should use the function `csasdown::csas_table()` instead. It just calls the function `kable()`, but it adds some default argument values that will make the tables render correctly in both LaTeX and in Word documents.

```{r maxdelays, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
csas_table(max_delays,
  col.names = c("Airline", "Max Arrival Delay"),
  caption = "Maximum Delays by Airline"
)
```

The last two options make the table a little easier-to-read.

Let's make a plot of the data:

```{r march3plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.cap="My caption."}
library(ggplot2)
flights %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```
