# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background


Amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019) include new Fish Stocks provisions that introduce legal
obligations to manage stocks to promote sustainability and avoid limit reference points, LRPs [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. The provisions also require plans to rebuild fish stocks that have declined to, or below, an LRP while taking into account the biology of the fish and environmental conditions facing the stock. These obligations apply to major fish stocks that are prescribed under regulations. These revisions reinforce the previously established DFO policies to manage stocks in line with the precautionary approach, including [The Fishery Decision Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/precaution-eng.htm)[@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009], also known as DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework within the [Sustainable Fisheries Framework](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/overview-cadre-eng.html) and Canada's [Wild Salmon Policy](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/policy-politique-eng.html) [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005a].

Under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock. At this stock status level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fishing opportunities [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. Serious harm to stocks are generally described in terms of impaired productivity, where declines are irreversible or only slowly reversible [@kronlundSelectionRoleLimit2018]. Serious harm can occur due to depensatory mortality (or allee effects) that occur because of, for example, increased predation rates or inability to find mates at very low abundances [@chenIncorporatingAlleeEffects2002a]. Because allee effects are only infrequently observed among marine fish species [@keithPopulationDynamicsMarine2012], and rarely detected for Pacific salmon (but see @cunninghamSizeSelectivityPredation2013), a biological basis for serious harm is often difficult to identify. 

Furthermore, the definition of serious harm from @dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009 indicates that LRPs should be *above* the level where serious harm occurs, not at the level where it is occurring, and that long-term losses should be avoided.  Defining the level before serious harm occurs to a species or ecosystem is a pervasive challenge as harm is often not identified until it is already occurring [@hilbornQuantitativeFisheriesStock1986]. Also, this definition of serious harm mentions possible impacts on other ecosystem components, which are often challenging to identify because of limited data and poor understanding of mechanisms driving declines in productivity (but see @chagarisEcologicalReferencePoints2020).

Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, represents DFO's implementation of the Precautionary Approach Framework for Pacific salmon. The goal of the WSP is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005a]. One objective of the WSP is to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon by maintaining and protecting, Conservation Units, defined as a "group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations" (DFO 2005). 

Differences in adaptive traits among CUs results in diversity in CU-level responses to threats and environmental drivers. Portfolio effects have been established for numerous salmon stocks, defined as population aggregates containing population and life-history diversity which produce temporally stable recruitment because of the complementary or independent dynamics among sub-populations [@schindlerPopulationDiversityPortfolio2010a]. Population and life-history diversity can buffer species from environmental variability and contribute to long-term stability through differing responses to environmental changes, e.g., those anticipated under climate warming. Deterioration of portfolio effects have been observed for Pacific salmon in Canada, in part due to fishing practices that ignored underlying population structure (e.g., structure at the CU level) and associated biodiversity [@pricePortfolioSimplificationArising2021a].

Under the WSP, status of individual CUs is represented by comparing status indicators to biological benchmarks delineating three zones of status, green, amber, and red. These zones represent increasing conservation concern from green to red requiring increasing management intervention. The lower benchmark, delineating the red and amber zones, is intended to be at the level to "ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC", the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). One recommended lower benchmark on spawning abundances is the abundance resulting in recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, $S_{gen}$ [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. Benchmarks for data-limited contexts have also been identified in recognition that the data required to estimate spawner-recruitment based benchmarks are not always available. See Section \@ref(cu-est-methods).


Under the WSP, the assessment of Pacific salmon has focused on setting benchmarks for individual salmon CUs [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005a], the revised Fisheries Act includes language indicates that a single LRP may be required for each "Major Fish Stock" [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. In the context of Pacific salmon, "Major Fish Stocks" are defined as Stock Management Units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve joint status.  This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for management at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain all CUs within an SMU above their lower benchmarks. The present work expands on the previous work by providing guidance on establishing LRPs for management of Pacific salmon SMUs.  Given the similar intent of LRPs defined by DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework and lower benchmarks under the WSP, lower benchmarks can be used as proxies for LRPs but applied at the scale of CUs instead of SMUs. Our challenge is to identify LRPs that integrate status represented by WSP benchmarks across component CUs to the scale of SMUs. 




## Review of Reference Points for Pacific Salmon
 <!--
CW: Consider changing this subtitle to "Reference Points and management benchmarks for Pacific Salmon populations
CH: I think we should keep benchmarks as biological values as defined in the WSP, i.e. not management benchmarks. We've spent along time trying to differentiate biologically based benchmarks developed under the WSP for OCPs used in management". Also, I moved the reference to other policies up, and am trying to differentiate LRPs from OCPs, though LRPs can inform OCPs (and are used in them sometimes) I'd like to distinguish them at least theoretically, so added some text explicitly on this above and made some revisions here--> 

LRPs are commonly used in the assessment and management for marine fisheries where they are used to identify and communicate statuses and inform harvest control rules. Reviews of the application of reference points and harvest control rules can be found in @kvamsdalHarvestControlRules2016 and @puntHarvestControlRules2010. @dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015 reviewed the use of harvest control rules and management procedures in data-poor fisheries. In Canada, @sheltonLimitsOverfishingReference2002 provided an overview of the implementation of the precautionary approach and LRPs before the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework in 2009. They highlight that, at that point in time, there was limited evidence of the implementation of the precautionary approach in Canadian fisheries. In contrast, 12 years after the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, a review by @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021 showed that the principles of the Framework, including the adoption of LRPs, are now widespread in the management of Canadian stocks. This review was based on a survey of 177 Canadian stocks of cultural, economic and/or environmental importance, excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks. They identified that 102 stocks had adopted LRPs, although the method used to estimate the LRPs varied considerably among stocks. @kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 also reviewed the use and definition of LRPs in the context of Canadian and international Policy. They highlight the importance of embedding LRPs into management objectives with associated tolerance (probability) statements, e.g., "stock status should be maintained above the LRP 90% of the time", as the tolerance statement is required to render the LRP operational. Diagnosing where serious harm is occurring is a pervasive challenge when identifying LRPs, as is addressing the impacts of non-stationarity in underlying biological processes such as natural mortality [@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021].

Less frequently, multidimensional approaches that aggregate status over numerous biological characteristics have been applied to indicate serious harm to marine fish species. These approaches are particularly relevant when traditional abundance-based metrics are not estimable or not applicable or when data availability is limited [@dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015]. Multidimensional approaches allow for consideration of multiple data sources often including expert knowledge to integrate conflicting metrics within assessments. For example, multidimensional reference points have been applied to Snow Crab in Canada, where data on CPUE, egg clutches and discards are integrated in stock assessments [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018].

For Pacific salmon, @portleyLimitReferencePoints2014 reviewed the use of LRPs and biological benchmarks in the US (Alaska and Pacific Northwest), Canada, Russia, and Japan. They highlight the role of LRPs and lower benchmarks in allowing for cross-jurisdictional comparisons of sustainability. In Canada, @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 reviewed the use of reference points, including lower benchmarks and LRPs, in the assessment and management of salmonids and other semelparous species. 


Under Canada's WSP, status assessments generally integrate data across numerous dimensions of population characteristics, including current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends in abundances, distribution of spawning, and fishing mortality relative to productivity, with benchmarks along each metric [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009].  One advantage of this approach is that CUs missing data for any single metric can still be evaluated against remaining metrics, making the framework applicable across a relatively broad range of CUs. A second advantage is that a single-metric dropping below the benchmark may not trigger red status over all given high variability in abundances for some CUs. In general, persistence at low levels below abundance-based benchmarks and significant declining trends are required for red status overall. <!--CH comment; this is still a problem for logistic regression based LRPs that are impacted by CUs dropping below LBMs in only a single year even if not associated with what local experts would deem serious harm. I have highlighted this as uncertainty for that approach in the last chapter of this WP.--> Expert-driven processes to integrate sometimes conflicting metrics within the multidimensional framework have been implemented for numerous Pacific salmon stocks in Canada (e.g., Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, *Oncorhynchus nerka* [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011, @grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013, @grant2017FraserSockeye2020], Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, *Oncorhynchus kisutch* [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015], and Southern BC Chinook Salmon, *Oncorhynchus tshawytscha* [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016]). One challenge in implementing these expert-driven assessments is high demand on time and staff resources. Based on the consistencies that emerged from assessments where the integration of multiple metrics has been applied, (Pestal et al. in prep) developed an algorithm to approximate overall WSP status by combining those metrics in a decision tree, at the scale of CUs. This algorithm, known as the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool, was ground-truthed by local assessment experts and tested with stocks not included in the original formulation.


In some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawning biomass is compared with an abundance-based benchmark, have been used as proxies for status outside of DFO [@pacificsalmonfoundationMethodsAssessingStatus2020] and occasionally within DFO (e.g., Barkley Sockeye Salmon @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012). While biological assessments under the WSP are implemented at the scale of Conservation Unit, CU, fisheries management often operates at larger scales, aggregating over multiple CUs. For some stock aggregates, harvest control rules are developed to achieve a low probability of  individual CUs breaching their lower benchmark on spawner abundances, among other socio-economic considerations, e.g., Fraser River sockeye salmon [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012]. This approach supports management of weak stocks and is aligned with DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009].


<!--KH: 
- Are there examples where aggregate abundance-based LRPs are used for in-season HCRs?  E.g., once an escapement goal has been met, surplus production can be harvested? I'm not sure how often this applies to the SMU level though. Does Fraser Sockeye do anything like this?
CH: I think the pgh above starts to get at this, though let me know if you think we should expand more.

- KH: Also, is it worth mentioning cases like Nass / Skeena Sockeye were abundance-based LRPs are required for other management processes (PST), and there is a desire to identify aggregate-abundance based LRPs for those processes that have a high probability of maintaining CU-level abundances above red.  
CH: I added this to CH4, step 7, when deciding if aggregate-abundance based LRPs are necessary. Let me know if you think it should be here too
-->




## Alternative spatial scales

The Fish Stock provision pertain to the management of fisheries. For Pacific salmon, threats occur at a range of spatial scales from local habitat disturbances impacting local spawning habitat, to regional-scale climate changes. Also, multiple levers are used by managers to achieve objectives for Pacific salmon which extend beyond fisheries, including habitat restoration and hatchery enhancement, which also occur at a variety of spatial scales.  Indeed, for many SMUs, fisheries have been limited in recent years [@grantStateCanadianPacific2020], such that habitat and hatchery management are playing an increasingly dominant role in management responses. These decisions require stock assessments and responses at a hierarchy of spatial scales from a watershed-level within CUs to larger aggregates of CUs at regional-scales, sometimes across Pacific salmon species. The LRPs presented here are applied at the SMU scale, though methods could also be applied at smaller or larger scales to inform a variety management decisions.

Alternative spatial scales of assessment and management are used by agencies outside of DFO for Pacific salmon, including Designatable Units used by COSEWIC and Management Units under the Pacific Salmon Treaty. These units are not aligned with the biological unit of conservation under DFO's WSP, CU, and are not considered further here.

A mismatch in scales among biological stocks, the unit of management, and the spatial scale of data collection are not uncommon among marine fish species, especially invertebrate species [@dfoProceedingsNationalPeer2016; @mullowneyBiologicalPerspectivesComplexities2020], creating challenges when identifying LRPs [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. This mismatch can make undesirable states in fish populations difficult to detect, and weaken the effectiveness of resulting management measures. <!--CH: could include snow crab example from Mullowney et al. 2020 if we wanted to flush this out a bit. I couldn't find any reference for American Lobster- i.e., Adam Cook's ppt from TESA workshop-->

## Goals of Working Paper

The goals of this working paper were to:

1. Develop candidate methods for identifying SMU-level LRPs for Pacific salmon that are consistent with the Wild Salmon Policy objective of conserving biodiversity by maintaining CUs above lower biological benchmarks.  These candidate methods include LRPs based on the status of component CUs and aggregate abundance over multiple CUs, where CU assessments can be developed using a multidimensional or single-metric approaches, as appropriate. (See \@ref(est-methods))

2. Document candidate methods for developing LRPs at the SMU-level, including data requirements and assumptions. (See \@ref(est-methods) and \@ref(app:first-appendix)) 

3. Document key uncertainties that affect LRP estimates for each method considered, including 
uncertainties arising from missing or limited CU-level data. (See \ref(recommendations))

4. Provide guidance and recommendations on the application of candidate methods over a range of data types and availability. (see \@ref(guidelines))

Pacific salmon are unique among marine fish species because of their anadromous and semelparous life-history and significant meta-population structure, which results in differences in data availability and modelling approaches for assessments. These differences necessitate advice on LRP development that is specific to Pacific salmon, while being consistent with the principles for LRP development across species (Marentette et al. in prep). <!--CH: add Marentette et al. in prep  as footnote, like Holt et al in review, and likely Pestal et al. in prep/review?--> 


## Scope of Working Paper

A companion Working Paper (Holt et al. in review) provides further details on candidate methods for developing LRPs and their implementation on three case studies. Our applications of LRP methods are for demonstration purposes only, and are not meant to be formal implementation of LRPs for those SMUs. While candidate LRPs were evaluated to an extent through sensitivity analyses and retrospective analyses, a more rigorous closed-loop simulation evaluation of candidate LRPs was beyond the scope of both working papers, and is recommended as a next step.

The LRPs considered here focus on serious harm to the stock. We have not included metrics or benchmarks of the status of salmon habitat [@stalbergCanadaPolicyConservation2009] or the ecosystem as a whole, though future analyses could more capture a more thorough perception of the nature of serious harm to salmon that includes those dimensions.  

While one role of LRPs is to trigger the development of rebuilding plans under the Fish Stock provisions, the content and implementation of rebuilding plans is beyond the scope of this paper. A full review of how LRPs can be integrated into salmon management processes outside of the Fish Stock provisions is beyond our scope, and is a gap that warrants further discussion.  We highlight a few possible roles for LRPs below. We also do not review the current definition of 'major stock' as a SMU for Pacific salmon under the Fish Stock provisions.

Time-varying population processes, such as changes in productivity, have important impacts on biological benchmark, LRPs, and assessment against LRPs. While we describe some recent approaches for considering those changes, a full review and evaluation of impacts of time-varying parameters on LRPs is beyond our scope though is an important area of future research.

While we follow the recommendation of @holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009a to assess status of CUs using multiple metrics, we have implemented this approach using a multidimensional algorithm, the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool, documented in Pestal et al. (in prep), developed from the implementation of formal, peer-reviwed WSP assessments for Pacific salmon stocks in Canada. A full review of the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool is beyond the scope of this paper.  Furthermore, a review of individual benchmarks of CU status is beyond the scope of this paper.

Decisions about prioritizing CUs for conservation within an SMU (e.g., evaluating the costs and benefits of conserving individual CUs given differential vulnerability to climate change or other stressors) is also beyond our scope, requiring a broader discussion with managers and stakeholders.
 


## Enhancement

For many stocks, hatcheries contribute to spawning abundances and are used as a conservation tool and to increase the availability of fish for harvest. Hatchery enhancement can also reduce wild genetic diversity and is considered a risk factor for the long-term sustainability of CUs [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Salmon that are enhanced by hatcheries are not considered "wild" under the Wild Salmon Policy and are not usually included in assessments of biological status. However separating out the influence of hatchery enhancement in time-series of spawner abundances and recruitment is challenging, in part because hatchery-origin fish are not usually visibly marked and so are indistinguishable from natural-origin spawners. 


Following @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018, we recommend including only populations without significant enhancement in analyses of CU and SMU status. Proportionate Natural Influence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural populations, with values < 0.5 indicating integrated-hatchery populations, where most fish are hatchery origin, values  $\geqslant$ 0.5 indicating integrated-transition where natural-origin fish predominate, and values $\geqslant$ 0.72 indicating integrated-wild populations, where most fish are considered 'wild' under the WSP with parents who were born in the natural environment [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. While these guidelines were developed for Chinook Salmon where hatchery enhancement is most common, they are also applicable to other salmon species [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. 

@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018 recommend the inclusion of integrated-wild and provisionally, integrated-transition populations (i.e., PNI  $\geqslant$ 0.5 ) for assessments under the WSP. Similarly, only populations with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.5 were included in the assessment of CU and SMU status here. Stricter definitions of hatchery enhancement can be considered by including only populations with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.72. In practice, applying this stricter threshold for our case study on Chinook Salmon resulted in excluding most data as consistent time-series are only available for indicator populations where coded-wire tags have been applied, which is exclusively populations with hatcheries. Adopting a threshold of $\geqslant$ 0.5, a level associated with most fish being natural origin, was the result of a trade-off between assessing remaining CU-level biodiversity and excluding significant hatchery impacts. For some populations, early periods of high enhancement can be removed from time-series and assessments can focus on recent periods without significant enhancement [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011].

For integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations, WSP assessments of status have generally removed the demographic influence of hatchery production from time-series of abundances when data on the proportion of hatchery- vs. natural-origin fish on the spawning grounds are available (e.g., from marking of hatchery-origin fish) [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015]. Specifically, the contribution of hatchery-origin fish are removed from both the benchmark estimation and metric of stock status. For stock-recruitment based benchmarks, the contribution of hatchery-origin fish are removed from recruitment estimates but not escapement, as it is assumed that these fish reproduce successfully in the wild and contribute to natural production. This way the spawner-recruitment relationship represents the production derived from spawners in the natural environment. For the current metric of stock status, the contribution of hatchery-origin fish is removed from spawner time-series to remove the influence of variability in annual production from hatcheries on current status [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015].


In some cases where hatchery-origin fish are not marked, data on the proportion of hatchery-origin fish are not available for integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations. In these cases, WSP assessments generally rely on total spawner abundances regardless of hatchery contribution (e.g., Southern BC Chinook Salmon, @dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016). In these cases, there may be risks that current status reflects hatchery production which masks changes in natural production. These risks are partly mediated but not dismissed by removing populations that are dominated by hatchery-origin fish from assessments.

In addition, some populations without hatcheries may be influenced by straying from out-of-basin hatcheries. A very large fraction of fish are wild but gene flow modelling suggests a long-term increasing in genetic influence of hatcheries as straying increases [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. The impact of these strays are generally not included in assessments in part because of absence of visible marking on hatchery fish or genetic studies to determine their influence, and so they are included in total abundances. Studies evaluating the extent of straying for Chinook Salmon for the West Coast of Vancouver Island are on-going (W. Luedke pers. comm.)

<!--CH removed: "Recruitment data are generally not available for these stocks, so stock-recruitment analyses are usually not implemented. In one exception for Pitt River Sockeye Salmon,  spawner abundances were determined from brood take plus total spawners in the natural environment and recruitment was total recruits from both hatchery and natural environment (Pitt River, Grant et al. 2011)".-->


## Role of LRPs {#roleLRPs}

LRPs have several roles, including triggering rebuilding plans under the Fisheries Act, communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public, and informing management decisions about fisheries. LRPs are biologically based values that are separate from management measures, but can be used to inform management decisions. For example, LRPs can be used to identify operational control points which are points where management actions are triggered within harvest control rules, but are not necessarily operational control points themselves. Within a harvest control role, a conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where serious harm is occurring which can be translated to a measurable objective to avoid spawner abundances lower than an LRP with a high probability (e.g., 95%) over a specified time period.  However, operational control points can be identified to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic objectives, beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers and stakeholders. In contrast, DFO's Science Sector is responsible for identifying LRPs using biological considerations [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. 


More generally, LRPs can be used within a Management Procedure Framework (or Management Strategy Evaluation) to identify those procedures that achieve conservation objectives (e.g. 95% probability of staying above LRP over a specified period) among other objectives, without being explicitly specified [@dfoManagementProcedureFramework2021]. This approach includes uncertainties in the biology of the stock, dynamics of the fleet, observation of abundances and associated biological characteristics, and the implementation of management decisions. LRPs are identified within the model to evaluate performance of various management procedures, where LRPs and associated spawning stock values are specific to a set of assumptions (random draws) and are integrated over those uncertainties to derived overall performance.<!--CH: is this too much jargon?--> One advantage of this approach is that a single best underlying model (or LRP) describing the population and fleet dynamics need not be identified; instead management procedures can be evaluated against a suite of plausible underlying models or assumptions. Although increasingly common in marine fisheries, the application of a Management Procedure Frameworks is less common for Pacific salmon where the impact of diverse management levers are often difficult to quantify (e.g., hatcheries and harvest, though see the AHA model documented by @hsrghatcheryscientificreviewgroupColumbiaRiverHatchery2009) and stocks assessmentment have typically not integrated uncertainties in estimates of spawner abundances with reference point derivation (but see @scheuerellIntegratedPopulationModel2021 and @statonIncorporatingDemographicInformation2021). Simulation evaluation of management procedures is widely viewed as a best practice for informing management decisions under uncertainty [@puntEssentialFeaturesNextgeneration2020a]. The roles of LRPs will likely evolve for Pacific salmon over time, and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this paper.


<!--CH side note:  DFO's Fisheries Sustainability checklist shows LRPs that usually management operational control points, and not biological LRPs per se-->


## Process to identify candidate LRPs and guidelines

A technical working group was developed to capture expertise and knowledge associated with biological basis of serious harm to SMUs to support the development and application of candidate methods for LRPs, composed of DFO and First Nations analysts. The technical working group was not meant to be a venue for engagement or to capture stakeholder perspectives or socioeconomic objectives, considerations that are included when developing management responses to stock assessments.

In particular, the technical working group informed five components of the work: 

1. Principles for the development of Pacific salmon LRPs (make a new chapter)

2. A tool kit of candidate LRP methods (see \@ref(est-methods)

3. A demonstration of the application of candidate LRPs to case studies (see \@ref(case-studies))

4. Recommendations on when, and when not to use each candidate LRP method (see \@ref(guidelines))

5, Recommendations on future research (see \@ref(recommendations))
