# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background & Motivation for Project


Amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019) include new Fish Stocks provisions that introduce legal
obligations to manage stocks to promote sustainability and avoid limit reference points, LRPs {@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary202}. The provisions also require plans to rebuild fish stocks that have declined to, or below, an LRP while taking into account the biology of the fish and environmental conditions facing the stock. These obligations apply to major fish stocks that are prescribed under regulations. These revisions reinforce the previously established DFO policies to manage stocks in line with the precautionary approach, including [The Fishery Decision Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/precaution-eng.htm)[@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009], also known as DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework within the [Sustainable Fisheries Framework](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/overview-cadre-eng.html) and Canada's [Wild Salmon Policy](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/policy-politique-eng.html, DFO's implementation of the precautionary approach for Pacific salmon [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005].


Under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock. At this stock status level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fishing opportunities (DFO 2009). It is also generally described in terms of impaired productivity, where declines are irreversible or only slowly reversible, e.g., due to allee effects [@kronlundSelectionRoleLimit2018]. Sustainable fisheries management is based on the assumptions of that rate of population increase is reduced as density dependence weakens at low abundances. However, increased predation rates or inability to find mates at low abundances may actual reduce the the rate of population increase [@chenIncorporatingAlleeEffects2002a]. Failing to protect stocks above the LRP means that impacts of human disturbances such as fishing may be long term and only slowly reversible if at all.

LRPs are biologically based values that are separate from management measures, but can be used to inform management decisions. For example, LRPs can be used to identify operational control points which are points where management actions are triggered within harvest control rules, but are not necessarily operational control points themselves. Operational control points are identified to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic objectives, beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers and stakeholders.

<!--CH side note:  DFO's Fisheries Sustainability checklist are typically management operational control points, and not biological LRPs per se-->


<!--CH: moving intro to WSP, CUs and benchamrks up to here-->

For Pacific salmon, Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, informs the development of LRPs and is DFO's implementation of the Precautionary Approach Framework for Pacific salmon. The goal of the WSP is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005]. One objective of the WSP is to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon by maintaining and protecting, Conservation Units, defined as a "group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations" (DFO 2005). Biological benchmarks delineating three zones of status, green, amber, and red have been identified to represent zones of increasing conservation concern requiring increasing management intervention. The lower benchmark, delineating the red and amber zones, is identified at the level to "ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC", the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). <!--CH: I drafted text to address Sue's point. Should we include or does introduce complexities that are not highly relevant to our goals?   "Due to the differences in metrics of status used by WSP and COSEWIC, buffers have been challenging to identify and in practice red status from WSP assessments tends to align with threatened or endangered designations by COSEWIC (Grant, S. pers. comm.)."-->One recommended lower benchmark is spawner abundances resulting in recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, $S_{gen}$ [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. 

Status assessments under the WSP generally integrate data across numerous dimensions of status, including spawner abundances, short and long-term trends, distribution of spawning, and fishing mortality relative to productivity [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009].  The multidimensional framework for defining biological units and their assessment under the WSP has been adopted widely in Canada (e.g., Fraser River sockeye salmon [CSAS SAR on two WSP assessments], IFR coho [CSAS SAR on WSP assessments from 2014], Southern BC chinook salmon [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016], Skeena report [Anything in prep from Charmaine?], PSE [citation to PSF's Tech Report describing PSE]). 




## Review of Reference Points for Pacific Salmon
 <!--

CW: Consider changing this subtitle to "Reference Points and management benchmarks for Pacific Salmon populations
CH: I think we should keep benchmarks as biological values as defined in the WSP, i.e. not management benchmarks"

 -->

<!--CH I moved the reference to other policies up, and am trying to differentiate LRPs from OCPs, though LRPs can inform OCPs (and are used in them sometimes) I'd like to distinguish them at least theoretically, so added some text explicitly on this above and made some revisions here--> 

LRPs are commonly used in the assessment and management for marine fisheries where they are used to identify and communicate statuses and inform harvest control rules. Reviews of the application of reference points and harvest control rules can be found in @kvamsdalHarvestControlRules2016 and @puntHarvestControlRules2010. @dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015 reviewed the use of harvest control rules and management procedures in data-poor fisheries. In Canada, @sheltonLimitsOverfishingReference2002 provided an overview of the implementation of the precautionary approach and LRPs before the publication of the PA policy in 2006. They highlight that, at that point in time, there was limited evidence of the implementation of the precautionary approach in Canadian fisheries. In contrast, 15 years after the publication of the PA policy, a review by @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021 showed that the principles of the PA policy, including the adoption of LRPs, are now widespread in the management of Canadian stocks. This review was based on a survey of 177 Canadian stocks of cultural, economic and/or environmental importance, excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks. They identified that 102 stocks had adopted LRPs, although the method used to estimate the LRPs varied considerably among stocks. @kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 also reviewed the use and definition of LRPs in the context of Canadian and international Policy. They highlight the importance of embedding LRPs into management objectives with associated tolerance (probability) statements, e.g., "stock status should be maintained above the LRP 90% of the time", as the tolerance statement is required to render the LRP operational. Diagnosing where serious harm is occurring is a pervasive challenge when identifying LRPs, as is addressing the impacts of non-stationarity in underlying biological processes such as natural mortality [@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021].



For Pacific salmon, @portleyLimitReferencePoints2014 reviewed the use of LRPs and biological benchmarks for Pacific salmon stocks in the U.S. (Alaska and Pacific Northwest), Canada, Russia, and Japan. They highlight the role of LRPs and lower benchmarks in allowing for cross-jurisdictional comparisons of sustainability. In Canada, @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 reviewed the use of reference points, including lower benchmarks and LRPs, in the assessment and management of salmonids and other semelparous species. <!--CH: check this reference/sentence-->The review was focused on the applications of lower benchmarks at the Conservation Unit (CU) level, providing a comprehensive overview of the different methods available to assess CU status and their historical applications. @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 also provide considerations on managing multiple stocks as unit, e.g. multiple CUs as an SMU, highlighting that mixed stock management requires more precautionary benchmarks to ensure that all sub units remain above their lower benchmarks.


<!--CH combine this pgh below with mention of multidimensional app for WSP assessetns above-->
 LRPs can be based on multiple stock metrics, including abundance trends, abundance, fishing mortality, and habitat distribution [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012]. In some instances, multi-dimensional approaches are also used. These approaches are particularly relevant when traditional benchmarks are not estimable or not applicable or when data availability is limited [@dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015]. Multi-dimensional approaches allow for consideration of multiple data sources and the explicit inclusion of expert knowledge in defining LRPs. In Canada,  multi-dimensional managements benchmarks have been applied to snow crab [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018]. The snow crab reference points incorporate information from CPUE estimates, egg clutches and discards to extends the scope of precaution and efficacy of the management framework. In the companion case study paper (Holt et al. in review), the multi-dimensional assessment approach introduced by (cite Pestal tech report) is used to approximate the integrated WSP status assessments for Pacific salmon CUs.  




<!--
CW: Are there any examples of integrates assessments for Pink salmon? I could not find any. 
CW: Do you know of any additional WSP assessment that could be added to the list above?

 Although the traditional application of the precautionary approach for the management of Pacific salmon has been focused on setting lower management benchmarks for individual salmon CUs [dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005], the revised fisheries act includes language indicating that a single LRP may be needed for each "Major Fish Stock" [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. In the context of Pacific salmon, "Major Fish Stocks" are defined as Salmon Stock Management Units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve joint status.  This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for management at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain all CUs within an SMU above their lower management benchmarks. The present work expands on the previous work by providing guidance on establishing LRPs for management of Pacific salmon SMUs. 


Scales of Pacific salmon assessment reporting

1. Wild Salmon Policy
2. COSEWIC 
3. Pacific Salmon Treaty Management Units
4. SMUs intended to represent “major fish stocks”, which the fish stock provisions in the new Fisheries Act will be applied to.  The proposed functional definition of an SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. It is likely that SMUs may be updated as managed approaches evolve; reviewing SMU definitions is outside the scope of this working paper. 
-Include consequences of using SMUs not aligned with CUs (i.e,  could lose component CUs if managing only to the aggregate SMU without considering of CU-level diversity)<!--CH comment: confirm with Diana Dobson/Ron that SMUs always contain one or more CUs, never partial CUS-->

-	Establish that LRPs for salmon should be consistent with the WSP
-	Unique characteristics of Pacific salmon data and assessment: e.g., diverse data available on various characteristics of population dynamics,	Multiple metrics and benchmarks are available that reflect this diversity
-	Project Goal: Provide analysts and managers with methodological tools and guidance to identify LRPs for SMUs.   Having guidelines that have been reviewed and published through CSAS will provide a scientific basis for individual applications of the methodology throughout the Pacific Region in consultation with Indigenous groups and stakeholders, and ensure consistency in application.

-- Enhancement not included

<!--CH notes to add  
•	Intro- maintaining CUs, portfolio effects to add resilience to threats over the long term, maintaining underlying biodiversity is important so it can buffer production during periods of declining productivity, and also ensure we have the diversity to maintain a species through environmental change
•	Intro: add section on scoping, as outlines in TWG Mtg #16 pptx. Also, do any of the principles from the ppt need to be brought into the paper?
•	Intro when defining Lower Benchmark: “the lower benchmark is defined as a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction” : SG: In practice this hasn’t been applied really. In the end a Red status CU largely aligns with an EN COSEWIC DU, etc. etc. I have looked at these comparsisons and really both WSP and COSEWIC align, we are not really creating any buffers b/w COSEWIC listing…so I would delete this as it just has confused things all along. 
o	“We can revise the background to say that methods have been developed that can calculate benchmarks for all CUs; however, DFO does not yet have a formal CU status for most CUs outside of select Fraser / Southern BC stocks.  We can also spend some time better describing WSP status assessments, as well as how they link to the aggregate LRP requirements of the fisheries act to help reduce the disconnect.

<!-- Suggested text from Sue when reviewing case study paper: 

An management unit (MU) is the group level LRPs are evaluated on. For Pacific Salmon, an MU is comprised of one or more CUs, where a CU is a fundamental unit of biodiversity for Pacific salmon. It is ‘a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations.’ (DFO 2005).

Pacific Salmon given their complex population structure, and freshwater and marine life stages, have unique considerations relative to marine species. For this reason, fisheries, which operate at the MU scale, is not the only management action that can be used to improve salmon production. In fact, catch has been considerably reduced in recent years (see SOPO Grant et al. 2021).  Habitat management and hatchery management are playing an increasing role in actions required to support salmon adaptation to climate change, and these require CU considerations within habitat aggregations, or down to the population level for hatchery ones. For marine species, the only lever is fisheries, so a single aggregate MU that relates to this scale makes most sense.

K.Holt note: some of this may be best in guidance paper?

## Role of LRPs {#roleLRPs}

- required under FA to trigger rebuilding
- BUT ,also can form part of management procedure framework. Kronlund et al. 2018 p. 8: "Limit reference points in isolation are not useful until they are embedded into fully specified measurable objectives. For example, a conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where stock productivity is compromised to the point of serious harm. This goal could be translated to a measurable objective stated as “avoid spawning biomass levels lower than a threshold biomass BLRP with 95% probability over the next 20 years.” This example illustrates a fully specified measurable objective that has three components:
1. An outcome of interest such as a limit to be avoided or a target to be achieved, e.g., avoid spawning biomass levels less than BLRP;
2. A desired probability of achieving the outcome in (1), e.g., 95$\%$ probability; and
3. A time-frame over which to measure performance with respect to achieving (1) and (2), e.g., 20 years"
-add some text from Kronlund et al. 2021 paper
- example of this in Groundfish MP framework. When used within MP framework. LRP may not need to be explicitly defined, as it is implicit within the framework (quote them on this point). One advantage of this approach is that no need to define single best assessment model. Instead, a range of plausible OMs can be included.

- to be consistent with DFO PA Framework 

- other roles? (e.g., prioritizing SMUs and planning monitoring/management).
- these roles have not been clearly defined yet, and require further discussion beyond this process

- While aggregate-abundance based LRPs can be used as part of, or to inform harvest control rules for fisheries management, more complex harvest control rules that include for example, time-area closures to limit CU-specific harvests may better achieve the underlying objective of maintaining CU statuses above red. Expand on this...
- refer to Groundfish MP Framework


<!-- DD's email from 26 Oct

•	I would also add that it seems to me that you cannot consider the LRP outside the management strategy, except this is obviously complicated since the LRP is supposed to be strictly science determined.  But consider SMUs where variable CU status is accommodated in the harvest control rules through measures such as time-area closures.  In other words, the SMU has multiple removal rates.   It would be more useful for Science to evaluate whether or not the harvest control rules were likely to be effective for the lower status CUs rather than presume a single control rule ...  in fact, this is how we work with FM often…

CH response
-On your last point, I agree we do need to identify a HCR that meets objectives (conservation, harvest, and socioeconomic etc.), where one of those objectives is having a low probability of dropping below an LRP (or equivalently, CU-level benchmarks). Yes, I agree the SMU can have multiple removal rates in the HCR that are set to achieve objectives. 
-And the choice of the HCR is species, stock, context-specific. Although our paper does not develop or evaluate those HCRs, that is certainly a next step that we will highlight.

-->

<!--CH: In the Guidelines paper, I would like to add text that aggregate-abundance based LRPs may not need to be identified explicitly for harvest management, if HCRs are identified and evaluated to have a low probability of CUs being red. We might want to pull this thread through the Introduction of the case study paper or better yet here in Ch2 here when abundance-based LRPs are mentioned. I will include similar, but expanded text in the Guidelines paper, referring to the Groundfish MP Framework) -->
