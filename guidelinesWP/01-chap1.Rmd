# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background & Motivation for Project


Amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019) include new Fish Stocks provisions that introduce legal
obligations to manage stocks to promote sustainability and avoid limit reference points, LRPs [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. The provisions also require plans to rebuild fish stocks that have declined to, or below, an LRP while taking into account the biology of the fish and environmental conditions facing the stock. These obligations apply to major fish stocks that are prescribed under regulations. These revisions reinforce the previously established DFO policies to manage stocks in line with the precautionary approach, including [The Fishery Decision Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/precaution-eng.htm)[@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009], also known as DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework within the [Sustainable Fisheries Framework](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/overview-cadre-eng.html) and Canada's [Wild Salmon Policy](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/policy-politique-eng.html [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005].


Under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock. At this stock status level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fishing opportunities [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. Serious harm to stocks are generally described in terms of impaired productivity, where declines are irreversible or only slowly reversible, e.g., due to allee effects [@kronlundSelectionRoleLimit2018]. Sustainable fisheries management is based on the assumption that the rate of population increase is reduced as density dependence weakens below unfished equilbrium levels. However, increased predation rates or inability to find mates at very low abundances may reduce the the rate of population increase, creating allee effects [@chenIncorporatingAlleeEffects2002a]. LRPs are designated at levels above where these irreversible or only slowly reversible changes occur. <!--omit: Failing to protect stocks above the LRP  means that impacts of human disturbances such as fishing may be long term and only slowly reversible if at all.-->




<!--CH: moved intro to WSP, CUs and benchamrks below and Ch2  here-->

For Pacific salmon, Canada's Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, is DFO's implementation of the Precautionary Approach Framework for Pacific salmon and informs the development of LRPs. The goal of the WSP is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005]. One objective of the WSP is to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon by maintaining and protecting, Conservation Units, defined as a "group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations" (DFO 2005). Biological benchmarks delineating three zones of status, green, amber, and red have been identified to represent zones of increasing conservation concern requiring increasing management intervention. The lower benchmark, delineating the red and amber zones, is identified at the level to "ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC", the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). <!--CH: I drafted text to address Sue's point. However it introduces complexities that are not highly relevant to our goals, and I'm considering omitting. Thoughts?   "Due to the differences in metrics of status used by WSP and COSEWIC, buffers have been challenging to identify and in practice red status from WSP assessments tends to align with threatened or endangered designations by COSEWIC."-->One recommended lower benchmark on spawning abundances is the abundance resulting in recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, $S_{gen}$ [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. 

Status assessments under the WSP generally integrate data across numerous dimensions of population characteristics, including current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends in abundances, distribution of spawning, and fishing mortality relative to productivity [@holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009].  This multidimensional framework for assessing assessment status under the WSP has been adopted widely in Canada (e.g., Fraser River sockeye salmon [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011, @grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013, @grant2017FraserSockeye2020], IFR coho [@dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015], Southern BC chinook salmon [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016]), though single metrics, spawning abundances relative to abundance-based benchmarks have been used as proxies for status outside of DFO [@pacificsalmonfoundationMethodsAssessingStatus2020] and within (e.g., Barkley sockeye salmon [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012] and Skeena River sockeye salmon (C. Carr-Harris pers. com.). 



## Review of Reference Points for Pacific Salmon
 <!--

CW: Consider changing this subtitle to "Reference Points and management benchmarks for Pacific Salmon populations
CH: I think we should keep benchmarks as biological values as defined in the WSP, i.e. not management benchmarks"

 -->

<!--CH I moved the reference to other policies up, and am trying to differentiate LRPs from OCPs, though LRPs can inform OCPs (and are used in them sometimes) I'd like to distinguish them at least theoretically, so added some text explicitly on this above and made some revisions here--> 

LRPs are commonly used in the assessment and management for marine fisheries where they are used to identify and communicate statuses and inform harvest control rules. Reviews of the application of reference points and harvest control rules can be found in @kvamsdalHarvestControlRules2016 and @puntHarvestControlRules2010. @dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015 reviewed the use of harvest control rules and management procedures in data-poor fisheries. In Canada, @sheltonLimitsOverfishingReference2002 provided an overview of the implementation of the precautionary approach and LRPs before the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework in 2009. They highlight that, at that point in time, there was limited evidence of the implementation of the precautionary approach in Canadian fisheries. In contrast, 12 years after the publication of DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework, a review by @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021 showed that the principles of the Framework, including the adoption of LRPs, are now widespread in the management of Canadian stocks. This review was based on a survey of 177 Canadian stocks of cultural, economic and/or environmental importance, excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks. They identified that 102 stocks had adopted LRPs, although the method used to estimate the LRPs varied considerably among stocks. @kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 also reviewed the use and definition of LRPs in the context of Canadian and international Policy. They highlight the importance of embedding LRPs into management objectives with associated tolerance (probability) statements, e.g., "stock status should be maintained above the LRP 90% of the time", as the tolerance statement is required to render the LRP operational. Diagnosing where serious harm is occurring is a pervasive challenge when identifying LRPs, as is addressing the impacts of non-stationarity in underlying biological processes such as natural mortality [@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021].



For Pacific salmon, @portleyLimitReferencePoints2014 reviewed the use of LRPs and biological benchmarks for Pacific salmon stocks in the U.S. (Alaska and Pacific Northwest), Canada, Russia, and Japan. They highlight the role of LRPs and lower benchmarks in allowing for cross-jurisdictional comparisons of sustainability. In Canada, @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 reviewed the use of reference points, including lower benchmarks and LRPs, in the assessment and management of salmonids and other semelparous species. While biological assessments under the WSP are implemented at the scale of Conservation Unit, CU, fisheries management often operates at larger scales, aggregating over multiple CUs. For some stock aggregates, harvest control rules are developed to achieve a low probability of  individual CUs breaching their lower benchmark, among other socio-economic considerations, e.g., Fraser River sockeye salmon [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012]. This approach supports management of weak stocks and is aligned with DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009].



Less frequently, multidimensional approaches that aggregate status over numerous biological characteristics have been applied to marine fisheries. These approaches are particularly relevant when traditional abundance-based metrics are not estimable or not applicable or when data availability is limited [@dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015]. Multidimensional approaches allow for consideration of multiple data sources often including expert knowledge to integrate conflicting metrics within assessments. In Canada,  multidimensional reference points have been applied to snow crab [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018]. The snow crab LRPs incorporate information from CPUE estimates, egg clutches and discards to extend the scope of precaution and efficacy of the management framework. For Pacific salmon, the multidimensional assessment approach introduced by (Pestal et al.) is used to approximate the integrated WSP status assessments for Pacific salmon at the scale of CUs (Holt et al. in review). Here we extend CU assessments based on the multi-dimensional approach to infer CU-level status.  

Although the application of the precautionary approach for the management of Pacific salmon has focused on setting biological benchmarks for individual salmon CUs [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005], the revised fisheries act includes language indicating that a single LRP may be needed for each "Major Fish Stock" [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. In the context of Pacific salmon, "Major Fish Stocks" are defined as Salmon Stock Management Units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve joint status.  This provision creates the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for management at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain all CUs within an SMU above their lower management benchmarks. The present work expands on the previous work by providing guidance on establishing LRPs for management of Pacific salmon SMUs. 


Scales of Pacific salmon assessment reporting

1. Wild Salmon Policy
2. COSEWIC 
3. Pacific Salmon Treaty Management Units
4. SMUs intended to represent “major fish stocks”, which the fish stock provisions in the new Fisheries Act will be applied to.  The proposed functional definition of an SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. It is likely that SMUs may be updated as managed approaches evolve; reviewing SMU definitions is outside the scope of this working paper. 
-Include consequences of using SMUs not aligned with CUs (i.e,  could lose component CUs if managing only to the aggregate SMU without considering of CU-level diversity)<!--CH comment: confirm with Diana Dobson/Ron that SMUs always contain one or more CUs, never partial CUS-->

-	Establish that LRPs for salmon should be consistent with the WSP
-	Unique characteristics of Pacific salmon data and assessment: e.g., diverse data available on various characteristics of population dynamics,	Multiple metrics and benchmarks are available that reflect this diversity
-	Project Goal: Provide analysts and managers with methodological tools and guidance to identify LRPs for SMUs.   Having guidelines that have been reviewed and published through CSAS will provide a scientific basis for individual applications of the methodology throughout the Pacific Region in consultation with Indigenous groups and stakeholders, and ensure consistency in application.

<!--CH notes to add  
•	Intro- maintaining CUs, portfolio effects to add resilience to threats over the long term, maintaining underlying biodiversity is important so it can buffer production during periods of declining productivity, and also ensure we have the diversity to maintain a species through environmental change
- SKeena paper on detriortaion of portfolio effects, price et al. 2021
•	Intro: add section on scoping, as outlines in TWG Mtg #16 pptx. Also, do any of the principles from the ppt need to be brought into the paper?
•	Intro when defining Lower Benchmark: “the lower benchmark is defined as a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction” : SG: In practice this hasn’t been applied really. In the end a Red status CU largely aligns with an EN COSEWIC DU, etc. etc. I have looked at these comparsisons and really both WSP and COSEWIC align, we are not really creating any buffers b/w COSEWIC listing…so I would delete this as it just has confused things all along. 
o	“We can revise the background to say that methods have been developed that can calculate benchmarks for all CUs; however, DFO does not yet have a formal CU status for most CUs outside of select Fraser / Southern BC stocks.  We can also spend some time better describing WSP status assessments, as well as how they link to the aggregate LRP requirements of the fisheries act to help reduce the disconnect.

<!--Sabrina email: In short, the management of hatchery produced fish must be separated from wild production. This is a bit tricky for WCVI as we don’t have enough information or data to quantitatively separate ‘natural’ and ‘hatchery’. It would be ideal to remove 1st generation hatchery-origin fish but for WCVI we simply don’t have that information. Strays have been a real issue but hard to quantify the impacts to each non-targeted hatchery system without collecting the data needed annually as each year would differ. How much stray to a particular system and for how long are factors but we don’t assess this enough or adequately. For example, during a M/R project in the Moyeha the 2010 half the samples were hatchery but only 12 samples were collected and the next year all samples were natural origin. 
We need to be clear to include this uncertainty for WCVI in the report stating results could change if more data was available to adequately and quantitatively (not just I see a clipped salmon or not but genetics and/or more directed projects to the cause) separate the hatchery/1st generation from natural spawners. This is after all a ‘tool-kit’ that has options to choose from but may not have the full picture until gaps are filled. Highlighting the much needed information to properly segregate hatchery to natural spawners would be required to adequately assess.-->

<!-- Suggested text from Sue when reviewing case study paper: 

An management unit (MU) is the group level LRPs are evaluated on. For Pacific Salmon, an MU is comprised of one or more CUs, where a CU is a fundamental unit of biodiversity for Pacific salmon. It is ‘a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations.’ (DFO 2005).

Pacific Salmon given their complex population structure, and freshwater and marine life stages, have unique considerations relative to marine species. For this reason, fisheries, which operate at the MU scale, is not the only management action that can be used to improve salmon production. In fact, catch has been considerably reduced in recent years (see SOPO Grant et al. 2021).  Habitat management and hatchery management are playing an increasing role in actions required to support salmon adaptation to climate change, and these require CU considerations within habitat aggregations, or down to the population level for hatchery ones. For marine species, the only lever is fisheries, so a single aggregate MU that relates to this scale makes most sense.

K.Holt note: some of this may be best in guidance paper?

## Role of LRPs {#roleLRPs}

LRPs have several roles, including triggering rebuilding plans under the Fisheries Act, communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public, and informing management decisions about fisheries and anthropogenic threats and possible mitigation (e.g., habitat and harvest). LRPs are biologically based values that are separate from management measures, but can be used to inform management decisions. For example, LRPs can be used to identify operational control points which are points where management actions are triggered within harvest control rules, but are not necessarily operational control points themselves. Within a harvest control role, a conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where serious harm is occurring which can be translated to a measurable objective to avoid spawner abundances lower than an LRP with a high probability (e.g., 95%) over a specified time period.  However, operational control points can be identified to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic objectives, beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers and stakeholders. In contrast, DFO's Science Sector is responsible for identifying LRPs using biological considerations [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021]. 
More generally, LRPs can be used within a Management Procedure Framework (or Mananagement Strategy Evaluation) to identify those procedures that achieve conservation objectives (e.g. 95% probaiblity of staying above LRP over a specified period) among other objectives, without being explicitly specified [@dfoManagementProcedureFramework2021]. This approach includes uncertainties in the biology of the stock, dynamics of the fleet, observation of abundances and associated biological characteristics, and the implementation of management decisions. LRPs are identified within the model to evaluate performance of various management procedures, where LRPs and associated spawning stock values are specific to a set of assumptions (random draws) and are integrated over uncertainties to derived over-all performance.<!--CH: is this too much jargon?--> One advantage of this approach is that a single best underlying model describing the population and fleet dynamics need not be identified; instead management procedures can be evaluated against a suite of plausible underlying models or assumptions. Although increasingly common in marine fisheries, the application of Management Procedure Frameworks is less common for Pacific salmon where the impact of diverse management levers are often difficult to quantify (e.g,. hatcheries and harvest, though see the AHA model documented by @hsrghatcheryscientificreviewgroupColumbiaRiverHatchery2009) and stocks assessmentment have typically not integrated uncertainties in estimates of spawner abundances with reference point derivation (but see @scheuerellIntegratedPopulationModel2021 and @statonIncorporatingDemographicInformation2021). This approach is widely viewed as a best practice for informing management decisions under uncertainty (ref).    
The roles of LRPs will likely evolve for Pacific salmon over time, and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this paper.

<!--CH side note:  DFO's Fisheries Sustainability checklist are typically management operational control points, and not biological LRPs per se-->



<!-- DD's email from 26 Oct



<!--CH: In the Guidelines paper, I would like to add text that aggregate-abundance based LRPs may not need to be identified explicitly for harvest management, if HCRs are identified and evaluated to have a low probability of CUs being red. We might want to pull this thread through the Introduction of the case study paper or better yet here in Ch2 here when abundance-based LRPs are mentioned. I will include similar, but expanded text in the Guidelines paper, referring to the Groundfish MP Framework) -->
