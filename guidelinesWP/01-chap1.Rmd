# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background & Motivation for Project
- Revised Fisheries Act received Royal Assent in June 2019.  
-	Changes to the Act include fish stocks provisions that introduce legal requirements to promote sustainability, avoid Limit Reference Points (LRPs) and implement rebuilding plans for depleted stocks.
-	Under these fish stock provisions, LRPs that represent the level below which serious harm is occurring will be required for major fish stocks prescribed in regulation.  LRPs define the trigger below which rebuilding plans will be required. 
-	Definition of a LRP under SFF, mentioning impacts on ecosystem, such as dependent species (see Pacific herring CSAS for an example), Fisheries Act, etc

"Sainsbury (2008) states that LRPs “… are set primarily on biological grounds to protect the stock from serious, slowly reversible or irreversible fishing impacts…”. "(see Kronlund et al 2018, p.4)

Failing to protect stocks above LRP means that impacts of fishing may be long term and only slowly reversible if at all.


-	“The choice of LRP needs to be feasible (separate from, but can be operationalized by, appropriate management measures), defensible (consistent with best practices), reliably estimated, and in line with the intent of the Precautionary Approach Policy regarding serious harm (DFO 2009).“ (DFO NHQ) 

<!--CH comment: mention that LRPs identified under DFO's Fisheries Sustainability checklist are typically management operational control points, and not biological LRPs per se-->

Scales of Pacific salmon assessment reporting

1. Wild Salmon Policy
2. COSEWIC
3. Pacific Salmon Treaty Management Units
4. SMUs intended to represent “major fish stocks”, which the fish stock provisions in the new Fisheries Act will be applied to.  The proposed functional definition of an SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. Note to readers, we are not reviewing SMUs in this document. Include consequences of using SMUs not aligned with CUs (i.e,  could lose component CUs if managing only to the aggregate SMU without considering of CU-level diversity)<!--CH comment: confirm with Diana Dobson/Ron that SMUs always contain one or more CUs, never partial CUS-->

-	Establish that LRPs for salmon should be consistent with the WSP
-	Unique characteristics of Pacific salmon data and assessment: e.g., diverse data available on various characteristics of population dynamics,	Multiple metrics and benchmarks are available that reflect this diversity
-	Project Goal: Provide analysts and managers with methodological tools and guidance to identify LRPs for SMUs.   Having guidelines that have been reviewed and published through CSAS will provide a scientific basis for individual applications of the methodology throughout the Pacific Region in consultation with Indigenous groups and stakeholders, and ensure consistency in application.

<!-- Suggested text from Sue when reviewing case study paper: 

An management unit (MU) is the group level LRPs are evaluated on. For Pacific Salmon, an MU is comprised of one or more CUs, where a CU is a fundamental unit of biodiversity for Pacific salmon. It is ‘a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations.’ (DFO 2005).

Pacific Salmon given their complex population structure, and freshwater and marine life stages, have unique considerations relative to marine species. For this reason, fisheries, which operate at the MU scale, is not the only management action that can be used to improve salmon production. In fact, catch has been considerably reduced in recent years (see SOPO Grant et al. 2021).  Habitat management and hatchery management are playing an increasing role in actions required to support salmon adaptation to climate change, and these require CU considerations within habitat aggregations, or down to the population level for hatchery ones. For marine species, the only lever is fisheries, so a single aggregate MU that relates to this scale makes most sense.

K.Holt note: some of this may be best in guidance paper?

## Review of Reference Points for Pacific Salmon
 <!--
CW: Consider cahngng this title to Review of Reference Points in Canada with focus on Pacific Salmon
 -->

Even before the royal assent of the revised fisheries act in 2019, many fisheries in Canada already has LRPs defined as part of their management framework. DFO policy documents such as the "Harvest Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach" (citation) and "Canada's Policy for conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon" (citation) already recommended the establishment of LRPs to protect fish stocks serious harm to managed populations. In compliance with these policies LRPs have been implemented in various marine fisheries across Canada [@marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021], examples include Pacific Herring [@kronlundSelectionRoleLimit2018], snow crab [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018], lobster [@cookFrameworkAssessmentOffshore2017], Atlantic salmon [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2015], and Fraser Sockeye  [@pestalMethodesMisesJour2012].


LRPs can be based on multiple stock metrics, including abundance trends, abundance, fishing mortality, and habitat distribution [@chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012]. In some instances, multi dimensional approaches are also used. These approaches are particularly relevant when traditional benchmarks are not estimable or not applicable or when data availability is limited [@dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015]. Multi-dimensional approaches allow for consideration of multiple data sources and the explicit inclusion of expert knowledge in defining LRPs. In Canada,  multi-dimensional managements benchmarks have been applied to snow crab [@mullowneyBasisPrecautionaryApproach2018]. The snow crab reference points incorporate information from CPUE estimates, egg clutches and discards to extends the scope of precaution and efficacy of the management framework.  In the case study paper (Holt et al. in review), we apply the multi dimensional assessment approach introduced by (cite Pestal tech report) to approximate the integrated status assessments for Pacific salmon stocks.  


The use of LRPs and other reference points and harvest strategies has been gaining considerable interest, leading to a few review papers in recent years. Recent reviews of the application of harvest control rules and reference points include @kvamsdalHarvestControlRules2016 and @puntHarvestControlRules2010.  @dowlingEmpiricalHarvestStrategies2015 reviewed the use of harvest strategies in data-poor fisheries.  @marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021 reviewed the use of LRPs in many fisheries across Canada. They summarize the use of harvest control rules as well as target and limit reference points to support the development of science guidelines for the implementation of precautionary approach in light of the revised fisheries act. @kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 provided an overview of LRP in the context of rebuilding strategies and in light of Canadian fisheries policy and the revised fisheries act.

In terms of salmonids, @portleyLimitReferencePoints2014 reviews the use of limit reference points (or their absence) for Pacific salmon stocks in the U.S. (Alaska and Pacific Northwest), Canada, Russia, and Japan. They highlight the role of LRPs in allowing for cross-jurisdictional comparisons of sustainability. In Canada, @chaputConsiderationsDefiningReference2012 reviewed the use of reference points, including LRPs, in the management of salmonids and other semelparous species. The review was focused on the stock/Conservation Unit (CU) level applications of LRPs and provides a comprehensive overview of the different methods available to assess CU status and their historical applications. It also provides considerations on managing multiple stock fisheries or managing multiple stocks as unit, it highlights that mixed stock management requires more precautionary benchmarks to ensure that all stocks remain above their limit reference points. Previous work and guidance on setting LRPs for pacific salmon focused on management at the CU level. The present work expands on the previous work by providing guidance on setting LRPs for management at the SMU level, i.e. a group of CUs, taking into consideration the need to maintain all CUs within an SMU above their limit reference points. 



## Role of LRPs

- required under FA to trigger rebuilding
- BUT ,also can form part of management procedure framework. Kronlund et al. 2018 p. 8: "Limit reference points in isolation are not useful until they are embedded into fully specified measurable objectives. For example, a conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where stock productivity is compromised to the point of serious harm. This goal could be translated to a measurable objective stated as “avoid spawning biomass levels lower than a threshold biomass BLRP with 95% probability over the next 20 years.” This example illustrates a fully specified measurable objective that has three components:
1. An outcome of interest such as a limit to be avoided or a target to be achieved, e.g., avoid spawning biomass levels less than BLRP;
2. A desired probability of achieving the outcome in (1), e.g., 95% probability; and
3. A time-frame over which to measure performance with respect to achieving (1) and (2), e.g., 20 years"
-add some text from Kronlund et al. 2021 paper
- example of this in Groundfish MP framework. When used within MP framwork. LRP may not need to be explicitly defined, as it is implicit within the framework (quote them on this point). One advantage of this approach is that no need to define single best assessment model. Instead, a range of plausible OMs can be included.

- to be consistent with DFO PA Framework 

- other roles? (e.g., prioritizing SMUs and planning monitoring/management).
- these roles have not been clearly defined yet, and require further discussion beyond this process

## Objectives of this Document
 - Provide guidance on setting LRPs for SMU
 - List alternative methods and highlight when they should be used and when they should be avoided 

## Approach Taken to Develop Guidelines
-	Describe Technical Working Group
-	Explain how case studies were used by the TWG to develop guidance
