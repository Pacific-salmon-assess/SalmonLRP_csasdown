# INTRODUCTION {#intro}

## Background & Motivation for Project
- Revised Fisheries Act received Royal Assent in June 2019.  
-	Changes to the Act include fish stocks provisions that introduce legal requirements to promote sustainability, avoid Limit Reference Points (LRPs) and implement rebuilding plans for depleted stocks.
-	Under these fish stock provisions, LRPs that represent the level below which serious harm is occurring will be required for major fish stocks prescribed in regulation.  LRPs define the trigger below which rebuilding plans will be required. 
-	Definition of a LRP under SFF, mentioning impacts on ecosystem, such as dependent species (see Pacific herring CSAS for an example), Fisheries Act, etc
-	“The choice of LRP needs to be feasible (separate from, but can be operationalized by, appropriate management measures), defensible (consistent with best practices), reliably estimated, and in line with the intent of the Precautionary Approach Policy regarding serious harm (DFO 2009).“ (DFO NHQ) 

<!--CH comment: mention that LRPs identified under DFO's Fisheries Sustainability checklist are typically management operational control points, and not biological LRPs per se-->

Scales of Pacific salmon assessment reporting

1. Wild Salmon Policy
2. COSEWIC
3. Pacific Salmon Treaty Management Units
4. SMUs intended to represent “major fish stocks”, which the fish stock provisions in the new Fisheries Act will be applied to.  The proposed functional definition of an SMU is a group of one or more Wild Salmon Policy Conservation Units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. Note to readers, we are not reviewing SMUs in this document. Include consequences of using SMUs not aligned with CUs (i.e,  could lose component CUs if managing only to the aggregate SMU without considering of CU-level diversity)

-	Establish that LRPs for salmon should be consistent with the WSP
-	Unique characteristics of Pacific salmon data and assessment: e.g., diverse data available on various characteristics of population dynamics,	Multiple metrics and benchmarks are available that reflect this diversity
-	Project Goal: Provide analysts and managers with methodological tools and guidance to identify LRPs for SMUs.   Having guidelines that have been reviewed and published through CSAS will provide a scientific basis for individual applications of the methodology throughout the Pacific Region in consultation with Indigenous groups and stakeholders, and ensure consistency in application.

##	Review of Reference Points for Pacific Salmon
- Brief review of reference points for salmon in other jursdictions
-	Include a few recent key CSAS documents identifying LRPs to show context for Pacific salmon LRPS (Pacific Herring, Atlantic salmon, Snow Crab (multidimensional approach))


##	Objectives of this Document
text

##	Approach Taken to Develop Guidelines
-	Describe Technical Working Group
-	Explain how case studies were used by the TWG to develop guidance
