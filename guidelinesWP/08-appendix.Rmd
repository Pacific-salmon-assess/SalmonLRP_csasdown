# RESOURCES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LRPS {#app:links}


- For single metrics of status used under the Wild Salmon Policy, see Github repository [WSP-Metrics-Pkg](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/WSP-Metrics-Pkg)
<!--CH remove for now, as they are private:
- For watershed-area model, link to Carrie's repository (currently private due to data concerns)
-	For multi-dimensional CU-status, link to Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool 
-->
- For implementation of proportion-based and aggregate abundance-based LRPs to three case studies, see Github repository [pacific-salmon-assess/SalmonLRP_RetroEval](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/SalmonLRP_RetroEval)
- For estimation of correlations among CUs within SMUs, see Github repository [pacific-salmon-assess/lrp-smu-corr](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/lrp-smu-corr)
- For write-up of this working paper, see Github repository
[pacific-salmon-assess/SalmonLRP_csasdown](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/SalmonLRP_csasdown)

All data manipulation and projections were performed in R.  TMB and TMBStan were used for estimation of stock-recruitment parameters and benchmarks for logistic regression- and projection-based LRPs.
