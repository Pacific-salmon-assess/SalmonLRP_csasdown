<!--(links to be added)-->

- For single metrics, link to WSP metrics repository
- For watershed-area model, link to Carrie's repository (currently private due to data concerns)
-	For multi-dimensional CU-status, link to Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool 
- For estimation of correlations among CUs within SMUs, see Github repository [lrp-smu-corr](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/lrp-smu-corr)
- For aggregate-based benchmarks link to example application of these methods to case studies.
- Note we used R for most data manipulation and projections.  We used TMB and TMBStan for estimation of stock-recuritment benchmarks and logistict-regression based LRPs.
-	Justification of using TMB/TMBStan for logistic regression based in part on integrated models to propagate uncertainty from stock-recruitment models through to LRP estimates (highlight integrated Sgen-LRP model and Watershed-Area model)
