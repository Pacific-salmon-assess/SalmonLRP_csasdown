# Guidelines for Applying LRPs {#guidelines}


## Stepwise approach for selecting LRPs

We recommend a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs, with the proportion of component CUs with status above red as the default method. Aggregate-abundance based LRPs are considered when required for local or international management, and are considered supplemental to the proportion of CUs with status above red. The step-wise approach considers data availability for candidate LRP methods and provides guidance when inconsistencies in status occur from applying multiple LRP methods. These steps can be adapted in the future as more methods are developed and/or these methods are further evaluated.

### Data Availability (Steps 1 and 2)

The first step is to compile CU-level data to support biological status assessments as described under the Wild Salmon Policy [@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009a; @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018b], where those data exist. These data include (but are not limited to) time-series of spawner abundances and biological benchmarks on spawner abundances.  This step generally includes aggregating fine-spatial scale data on stocks or spawning sites to the CU level. 

For many stocks, hatcheries contribute to spawning abundances and are used as a conservation tool and to increase the availability of fish for harvest. Hatchery enhancement can also reduce wild genetic diversity and are considered a risk factor for the long-term sustainability of CUs [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Therefore only indicator stocks without significant enhancement were included in our analyses. Proportionate Natural Influence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural populations, with values < 0.5 indicating Integrated-Hatchery populations where most fish are hatchery origin [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Only stocks with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.5 were included in the development of LRPs and assessment against those LRPs. <!--CH: comment. This text is repeated in the Case Study paper for WCVI CK. Remove the last two sentences here on PNI, or keep them here, but adjust/shorten them in the Case study paper?--> 


Second, CUs with available data to support CU-level assessments are identified. CUs with insufficient data to support assessments are considered data deficient. In particular, CUs were considered data deficient when data on current abundances or trends were missing or insufficient (i.e., no data in the most recent generation), and/or there were insufficient data to develop CU-specific benchmarks on spawner abundances, such as those derived from spawner-recruitment models, percentiles of spawner time-series, or habitat characteristics. In addition, a CU may be data deficient if data to resolve the existence of the CU is missing. For example, Holtby and Ciruna (2007) describe provisional CUs pending acquisition of genetic samples to differentiate them from neighbouring CUs. The specific data requirements for benchmark estimation differ according to the quantitative methods applied and context within which they are applied and therefore are not defined here. For example, benchmarks on spawner abundances developed from hierarchical multistock spawner-recruitment analyses would require fewer years of data than those based on individual stock-recruitment analyses depending on the information captured in the multistock spawner-recruitment data set. Furthermore, changes in environmental drivers over time may result in historical data that are no longer representative of current conditions. Local biological expertise is required to review available data prior to assessments to identify the extent to which they represent current status and trends and can be used to estimate benchmarks.


<!--CH comment: Should we be more prescriptive about CU-specific data deficiencies? The challenge is finding reports to inform this. How many years of data do we need for robust trend detection? PSE documentation? Brown et al. 2020 on Chinook? Skeena/Nass draft data report? These are not consistent and/or at different scales/metrics. I don't see anything in the SoS scanner draft documentation,  WSPmetrics github readmewiki, but I imagine DD rulesl are built in there somewhere-->
<!--CH comment: though maybe we can say something about # years required for trend analysis?  I've asked Gottfried and Bronwyn for advice from SoS-->

### Can Data Deficient CUs be Represented by CUs With Data? (Step 3)

Third, the extent to which status of data deficient CUs can be inferred from CUs with data is evaluated. By definition, data deficient CUs do not have data on population dynamics to rigorously evaluate this inference, though information on threats and biological characteristics may be available. To infer status for data deficient CUs, at a minimum we recommend published evidence that: (i) the threats impacting data deficient CUs are likely to be the same as for CUs with data, (ii) environmental drivers are also similar among CUs, .e.g, as reflected by distribution of CUs across biogeoclimatic zones, and (iii) biological characteristics, such as life-history type and dominant age-at-maturity of data-deficient CUs are represented in the CUs with data, and (iv) habitat capacity of data deficient CU is likely in the range of those represented by CUs with data. 

....

Information on threats may be derived from published, peer-reviewed habitat or threats assessments, and may include data on Genetic Stock Identification data from fisheries. CUs with


A biogeoclimatic zone is defined as "a geographic area having similar patterns of energy flow, vegetation and soils as a result of a broadly homogenous macroclimate.", suggesting similar environmental drivers within zones.     (https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf)

...previous notes...
CUs with similar life-history characteristics are more likely to respond to common threats and environmental drivers in the same way compared with those with divergent characteristics. 
Are landscape characteristics and environmental conditions sufficiently similar such that fish in different CUs are likely to respond similarly to common threats?
Do data exist to evaluate covariance in returns or spawner abundances among CUs in the historical record to assess the extent to which missing CUs can be represented by those with data? Are conditions similar to those in the historical record, such that covariance observed in the past is likely to still hold?
Results of meta-analyses of covariance in spawner abundances suggests that covariance among CUs within SMUs tend to be positive for  Pink, Chum, Coho, and Sockeye, and higher than that for Chinook (which is sometimes negative) (Brendanâ€™s Figure). These results suggest caution when representing SMU status for Chinook with only a subset of CUs.


Is most of the biological diversity represented by the CUs with data (e.g., as a general rule of thumb are > 50% of CUs are represented)

These criteria are not meant to be prescriptive, but provide general guidelines for assessing possible inference for data deficient CUs. Further research evaluating the value of these criteria (and others) is warranted to better inform this step.

If data deficient CUs do not meet the criteria for inference from remaining CUs, we recommend collection of CU-level data to inform biological assessments.

### OLD TEXT BELOW

### Proportion of CUs above lower benchmarks.
- Default LRP
- conditions when this might be most appropriate and not appropriate
-	General comment: when phrasing guidance, address when it is appropriate to use various methods as well as when it is NOT appropriate too use those methods

-	Default should be aggregate abundance associated with 100$\%$ of CUs being above their lower benchmark; however, there may be cases when a subset of CUs being below their lower benchmarks is permitted, such as where CUs are intrinsically at low levels and are not being significantly impacted by human threats such as fishing or habitat deterioration. 
-	These exceptions will need to be made on a case-by-case basis, with the rationale for these decisions well-documented.
-	Guidelines on rationale TBD

While the acceptable proportion of CUs below lower benchmarks can be thought of as a trade-off decision to be made by decision-makers, LRPs are intended to be defined by Science and represent a level of serious harm. -	Question: could serious harm may mean extinction rather that in the red zone?  

-	Question: could serious harm may mean extinction rather that in the red zone?  

-	The question of whether a CU within a larger SMU can persist in the red zone is something that could be simulation tested; although, this would require harvest control rules to be specified for testing.  Such an approach would be case-specific and outside of the scope of our work.  However, we could consider recommending that if a decision is made for a CU to allow some proportion of CUs to be in the red zone, quantitative evaluation (e.g., simulation testing) should be used to demonstrate that red CUs will not be lost. [Although, we may still want to consider putting some bounds on what proportion would be allowed to be below their lower benchmark, i.e., a large proportion of CUs persisting in the red zone may not be acceptable ].

-if using $<$100 $\%$ of CUs $>$ red, could recommend simulation testing

- Recommended process for identifying CU-level status: annual assessments through the State of the Salmon Program. For SMUs that are batched, experts can cross-check and refine information on interpretations and statuses provided by the Scanning Tool, thereby using an expert-driven process to trigger rebuilding plans


### Multi-dimensional approach
- similar to proportion of CUs > lower benchmark, but using other dimensions of status (e.g., trends)
- conditions when this might be most appropriate and not appropriate
- Maybe not appropriate as a sole mode of assessment, more as a scanning tool used to trigger more in depth assessment if MU is found to be below LRP?


### Aggregate-abundance LRP based on aggregate data

- conditions when this might be most appropriate and not appropriate
- informed by quantitative evidence for covariance among component CUs
- perhaps requiring simulation evaluation

### Aggregate-abundance LRP based on CU-specific data

-	Based on experience applying LRPs to case studies, develop recommendations on when aggregate abundance LRPs are appropriate or not. Do these recommendations depend on the number of CUs (e.g., what if the SMU only has 1 or 2 CUs)?

### Empirical vs. projected approaches for aggregate-abundance LRPS

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How do projection-based and empirical LRPs (and their uncertainties) compare?
-	What type of data and level of data-quality is required to support historic LRPs? 	How robust are empirical LRPs to different underlying scenarios (model formulations, observation errors, time-varying productivity and capacity)?
- What type of data and level of data-quality is required to support projected LRPs?  How robust are prospective LRPs to different underlying scenarios (model formulations, covariance in CU dynamics, implementation error, observation errors, time-varying productivity and capacity)
- Are projected LRPs always preferred when possible?  Under what circumstances are empirical LRPs warranted? Projected LRPs are appropriate when stock-recruitment models have been developed and peer-reviewed for component CUs. LRPs are highly sensitive to the choice of the stock-recruitment model, so this needs careful consideration.
-	To consider: could a projection-based approach be used for periodic intensive assessments and an empirical (logistic regression) approach be sufficient for annual updates?


## Guidance on scale of diversity used to define aggregate-abundance LRPs

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	When it is appropriate to group CUs together or split CUs into smaller sub-components?
- This should be identified on an SMU-by-SMu basis
- What (SMU-level) process should be recommended to decide the scale of assessment necessary to represent serious harm? 


## Guidance on the application of aggregate abundance LRPs

-	Modelling approaches: advantages and disadvantages of using integrated models to propagate uncertainty from stock-recruitment models through to LRP estimates (highlight integrated Sgen-LRP model and Watershed-Area model)
-	Recommended software: e.g., TMB, TMBstan, R
-	Recommended process:Do we recommend a CSAS review every time an LRP is identified for a SMU
- One option- we could recommend a CSAP Science Response for relatively stratigh-forward appications of the two aggregate abundance methods that we focus on here. In cases where other approaches, (e.g., multi-dimensional) or unique circumstances arise that have not been covered in this guidance document, a full CSAS Science Review should be considered.
- CSAS Special Science Responses (SSRs) could document and review LRPs for several SMUs at once (or review several SSR within one meeting)
- In some cases, LRPs could be documented and reviewed within rebuilding plan. For LRPs, but this would not cover SMUs that are batched, but do not require rebuilding plans.
- Look to National Working Group for guidance on required documentation and review of LRPs. What is required for other species?
- Suggestion to provide some flexibility when applying these methods given local context and data (e.g,, local expertise required when providing justification for persistence of CUs in the red zone; enhancement).

-	What is the appropriate measure of current abundances to compare against LRPs?
- To minimize annual variability in assessments and be consistent with WSP assessments (and other jurisdictions), we recommend using aggregate generational average abundance when comparing current SMU abundance to LRPs

## Selection of CU-level abundance-based benchmarks to use as a basis for LRP estimation (Placeholder)

Placeholder.  Thorough exploration of this topic may be out of scope for this Working Paper. We may decide that we do not need to go into this much detail given previous work that has been done to evaluate WSP benchmarks.

Intended to address TWG ToR objective: Evaluate and provide guidance on candidate lower biological benchmarks for data-limited CUs (e.g., percentile and watershed area-based approaches).


Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How do data availability and biological considerations interact to inform a decision about which CU-level benchmark to use? (e.g, Sgen from SSR vs. Sgen from Watershed-Area vs. percentile vs. distributional benchmarks, etc)?  
-	Under what conditions should Watershed-Area based LRPs be used?	
- How do mean and distributions (uncertainties) of watershed-area based and stock-recruitment based benchmarks compare?
- Under which levels of data uncertainties do stock-recruitment based LRPs outperform habitat-based LRPs? 
- In cases where watershed-area based benchmarks and stock-recruitment based benchmarks are available, both should be presented and used to derive complementary LRPs to capture our underlying model uncertainties.
- Alternatively, could be combined by using watershed area to inform prior on beta in the stock-recruitment model
- What if stocks have different levels of data, e.g., Fraser Sockeye, where stock-recruitment as available for some CUs, while others have only escapement data.  When is it beneficial to use available data for data poor CUs vs when to exclude them?

## Incorporating uncertainty in aggregate abundance LRP estimation

-	Parameter uncertainty can be incorporated through estimation methods (MLE with confidence intervals, Bayesian analyses, stochastic projections for the Projected LRP method).  However, larger structural uncertainties in model formulation will require consideration of reference and robustness scenarios to evaluate sensitivity of LRPs to those structural uncertainties.
-	How should uncertainty in benchmarks be incorporated in the LRP if different methods are used to estimate CU-level status within an SMU (i.e., some CUs have stock-recruitment benchmarks, while others rely on percentile-based or habitat-based benchmarks). Bootstrapping from uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks could be considered in these cases. Although, simulation testing of these scenarios may be outside the scope of this paper, guidance based on best-practices from the literature could be provided.
- For abundance-based empirical LRPs uncertainty in the relationship between aggregate abundance and the probability of that all CUs are above their lower benchmarks is provided by the CI's from the logistic regression
- Also, for both empirical and projected LRPs, that uncertainty can, to some extent, be demonstrated in sensitivity of the LRP to different choices of probability levels. If the LRP is very sensitive to probability level (50, 66, 90), this indicates the relationship between aggregate abundance and presence of CUs below their lower benchmark is uncertain. The the range in LRPs along various plausible p-values can be compared to the range of observed spawner abundances.

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How should alternative model formulations be considered when identifying LRPs?  (e.g., integrated into a single LRP or presented as two different LRPs?)

## Time-varying parameters and impacts on LRPs

  

 There is increasing evidence of time varying parameters in Pacific salmon populations, particularly relating to declines in productivity [e.g., @holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020,  @dornerSpatialTemporalPatterns2018, @malickRegionalScaleDeclinesProductivity2016, petermanWidespreadDecreaseProductivity2012]. In Canada, DFO assessments identified declines in productivity for various conservation units, e.g., Fraser sockeye [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011, @grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013, @huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021], Southern BC Chinook (cite SAR 2016/042), Fraser Chinook (Cite RPA)  and Interior Fraser Coho [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020]. These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the evaluation of trends in log spawners per recruit [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020], evaluation of trends in residuals from recruitment curve fits [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011], and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when fitting recruitment curves using Kalman filter or recursive Bayes approach [huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021 and RPA].
 
 Time-varying parameters affect estimates for stock recruitment reference points (e.g. $Smsy$ and $Sgen$) and are also likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations. These effects will have an impact on the classification of CUs status. However determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g. AIC and BIC) often produce conflicting results [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020]. @adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 reviewed stock recruitment analysis for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters. They highlight that even though there might be strong evidence for non stationarity in salmon populations, it is not clear if reference points should me adjusted accordingly. 

 There are no clear guidelines on how to proceed in terms of translating time-varying stock recruitment parameters into reference points, i.e. if time-varying reference points should be considered and how often they should be changed. Mistimed changes in reference points may lead to bias in stock status [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020]. In addition, volatility of management benchmarks may lead to management uncertainty and reduce trust in the management process. The Precautionary approach policy recommends that changes to the reference points should only be adjusted when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management (cite PA policy). Klaer et al 2015 devised a framework for evaluation the degree of confidence in productivity shifts in Australian fisheries, similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian Salmon populations. However, recent studies recommend the use of case specific feedback simulation exercises in order to determine the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non-stationary [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020 and @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021].  


<!--
CW comment: I am not sure if we want to formalize a LRP recommendation here, or just say that this question requires further consideration? 
Also may want to highlight that time-varing parameters will likely occur at the CU level, and is unlikely to affect all the CU's within an MU homogeneously. 


 old notes
-	Briefly document evidence for time-varying productivity for Pacific salmon
-	Summarizing recent DFO CSAS documents that include discussion of time-varying reference points for Pacific salmon, and recent primary publications:
- Summarize approach for considering time-varying productivity in WSP CU assessments (e.g., Kalman filter on productivity parameters))

@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 reviews stock recruitment analysis for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters. They highlight that even though there might be strong evidence for non stationarity in salmon populations, it is not clear if reference points should me adjusted accordingly. 

@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 recommends that any decision to introduce time-varying reference points be based on evidence supporting that rebuilding could reasonably be expected. They recommend the use of feedback simulations to illustrate the consequences of time-varying benchmarks and identify exceptional circumstances that should lead to re-examination of reference point and management measures. 

 @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021 illustrates the effects of time-varying recruitment parameters on MSY-based reference points for iteroparous fish stocks (cod and plaice). They highlight that more precautionary benchmarks are necessary to account for the parameter uncertainty in highly dynamic ecosystems. However, they observed that effects on reference points depend on the magnitude and structure of the stochasticity in stock-recruitment relationships, therefore they recommend case specific simulation studies be performed to identify explicit impacts on MSY-based reference points.

## Guidance on minimum number of years to estimate aggregate abundance LRPs

-	Synthesize retrospective analyses and simulation evaluations from 3 case studies described in Working Paper 2

## Guidance on developing aggregate abundance LRPs with missing CU-level data

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	When is infilling of escapement data appropriate?  
-	Synthesize retrospective evaluations and prospective evaluation for Working Paper 2. How do LRPs (and 95$\%$ CIs) vary with number of CUs (proportion of total within the SMU)?
-	What if data are only available for a portion of CUs within an MU? Under what conditions are those CUs representative of the MU? When is the MU considered data deficient? Are sampled CUs representative of other CUs?  Are their different threats within the SMU acting on different CUs? Is there any evidence for different CUs/populations responding differently to common threats?
-	What is the shape of the trade-off between number of years and number of CUs?

## Enhanced stocks

Questions to provide guidance on:

-	Should highly enhanced systems always be excluded?  How is highly enhanced defined? (consider PNI groupings based on Withler et al. 2018, and WSP CK groupings, Brown et al. 2014 in revision).

## Defining SMUs where LRPs cannot be developed

-	Under which conditions is a SMU considered data-deficient?

## Process for defining LRPs and assessing status against LRP
- recommendation for the Science-based process (e.g., within CSAS) to develop and review LRPs for individual application, and then evaluate status against the LRP. That process would include local expertise to resolve issues of spatial resolution (CU level or other), type of LRP to be used, model structure (if model-based LRPs are considered), etc..
