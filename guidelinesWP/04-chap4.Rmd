# Guidelines for Applying LRPs {#guidelines}
<!--CH question: what verb tense should I use in this section. I've tried present, but might not be entirely consistent-->


## Stepwise approach for selecting LRPs

We recommend a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs, with the proportion of component CUs with status above red as the default method. Aggregate-abundance based LRPs are considered when required for fisheries management (e.g., local or international), and are considered supplemental to the proportion of CUs with status above red. The step-wise approach considers data availability for candidate LRP methods and provides guidance when inconsistencies in status occur from applying multiple LRP methods. These steps can be adapted in the future as more methods are developed and/or these methods are further evaluated.

### Data Availability (Step 1)

The first step is to compile CU-level data to support biological status assessments as described under the Wild Salmon Policy [@holtIndicatorsStatusBenchmarks2009a; @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018b], where those data exist. These data include (but are not limited to) time-series of spawner abundances and biological benchmarks on spawner abundances.  This step generally includes aggregating fine-spatial scale data on stocks or spawning sites to the CU level. 

For many stocks, hatcheries contribute to spawning abundances and are used as a conservation tool and to increase the availability of fish for harvest. Hatchery enhancement can also reduce wild genetic diversity and are considered a risk factor for the long-term sustainability of CUs [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Salmon that are enhanced by hatcheries are not considered "wild" under the Wild Salmon Policy and not included in assessments of biological status. Therefore only indicator stocks without significant enhancement were included in our analyses. Proportionate Natural Influence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural populations, with values < 0.5 indicating Integrated-Hatchery populations where most fish are hatchery origin [@withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018]. Only stocks with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.5 were included in the development of LRPs and assessment against those LRPs. Stricter definitions of hatchery enhancement were considered (e.g., including only populations with PNI values $\geqslant$ 0.72, Integrated-Wild populations @withlerGeneticallyBasedTargets2018). In practice, applying this stricter threshold resulted in excluding almost all available data for our case study, West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook Salmon, a species that is widely enhanced. Adopting a slightly lower threshold of $\geqslant$ 0.5, a level associated with most fish being natural origin, was the result of a trade-off between assessing remaining CU-level biodiversity and excluding hatchery impacts. <!--CH: comment. some of this text is repeated in the Case Study paper for WCVI CK. Remove the middle two sentences here on PNI, or keep them here, but adjust/shorten them in the Case study paper?--> 
  
  
### Assessing Data Deficiency (Step 2)
  
Second, CUs with data to support biological assessments are identified. CUs are assessed based on a variety of metrics including abundances and trends, and are considered data deficient when data or benchmarks are insufficient on all metrics. For example, CUs are only considered data deficient when data to assess temporal trends in spawner abundances (over at least 3 generations) and data on current spawner abundances or associated CU-level abundance benchmarks  are missing or insufficient. As a general guideline, we define current spawner abundances as the geometric average spawner abundances over the  most recent generation, where data are insufficient on abundances if there are no data in the most recent generation. For short-term trend analyses, data are considered insufficient if they include less than half of available years or are of low quality representing only presence/absence, similar to criteria applied by @brown2020SummaryAbundance2020 to spawning sites of Chinook salmon in Southern BC. 

CU-specific benchmarks on spawner abundances can be derived from spawner-recruitment models, percentiles of spawner time-series, or habitat characteristics. Data requirements for benchmark estimation on spawner abundances differ according to the methods applied and are not explicitly defined here. For example, spawner-recruitment benchmarks developed from hierarchical multi-stock models require fewer years of data than those based on individual stock-recruitment models. In addition, changes in environmental conditions over time may result in historical data that are no longer representative of current conditions, resulting in data deficiencies related to trend metrics and benchmarks on spawner abundances. Local biological expertise is required to review available data and benchmarks prior to assessments to identify data deficiencies.

In addition, a CU may be data deficient if data to resolve the existence of the CU is insufficient. For example, @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007 describe provisional CUs pending acquisition of genetic samples to differentiate them from neighbouring CUs. 

Further work ground-truthing, expanding, and updating these guidelines for data deficiencies in the context of different salmon species, life-histories, and metrics is warranted.

### Can Data Deficient CUs be Represented by CUs With Data? (Step 3)
<!-- CH comment: send this section to Ron Kadowaki, Diana Dobson, and Brendan for review-->

Third, the extent to which status of data deficient CUs can be inferred from CUs with data is evaluated. By definition, data deficient CUs do not have data on population dynamics to rigorously evaluate this inference through SMU-specific correlation analyses, though information on threats and biological characteristics may be available. To infer status for data deficient CUs, at a minimum we recommend providing evidence that: (i) the threats impacting data deficient CUs are likely to be the same as for CUs with data,  (ii) environmental drivers are also similar among CUs, e.g., as reflected by the distribution of CUs across biogeoclimatic and Marine Adaptive zones, and (iii) biological characteristics, such as life-history type and dominant age-at-maturity of data-deficient CUs are represented in the CUs with data, and (iv) habitat capacity of data deficient CU is likely in the range of those represented by CUs with data. Evidence supporting these criteria should be clearly documented and reviewed by local experts. The burden of proof would be to identify that data deficient CUs have similar properties to neighbouring CUs, with the default assumption that each CU represents unique biodiversity where status and trends cannot be represented by other CUs. 

**Threats** are defined here is any human activity or process that causes harm, death, or behavioural changes to a species, or the destruction, degradation, and/or impairment of its habitat, to the extent that population-level effects occur [@dfoGuidanceAssessingThreats2014]. Information on threats may be derived from published threats and habitat assessments, and may incorporate harvest, effects of land-use in freshwater and estuarine habitats, climate change, and genetic impacts from hatcheries. Becuase SMUs are defined as groups of CUs that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status, it is likely that component CUs will have similar vulnerabilities to fisheries. Data on genetic stock identification from fisheries can be used to further assess similarities in vulnerabilities in harvest. Beyond fisheries, CUs that are vulnerable to different threats in freshwater and marine environment within an SMU may have divergent statuses and trends. 


Similarity in **environmental drivers** are reflected in part by biogeoclimatic zones, defined as "geographic areas having similar patterns of energy flow, vegetation and soils as a result of a broadly homogenous macroclimate." (BC Ministry of Forestry 2021, https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf <!--CH: add this as URL citation-->). In other words, these terrestrial zones have relatively uniform climate and vegetation. There are approximately 18 biogeoclimatic zones in BC and the Yukon, ranging from Coastal Douglas-Fir on southeastern Vancouver Island to Boreal White and Black Spruce in northern BC. CUs with spawning and rearing grounds within different biogeoclimatic zones may experience different macroclimates and hence environmental drivers in estuaries and freshwater. Instead of biogeoclimatic zones, @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007 delineate freshwater ecological drainage units to differentiate freshwater ecosystems for Pacific salmon ("Freshwater Adaptive Zones"). These units are defined based on shared zoogeographic histories at relatively fine spatial scales such that each CU tends to be associated with a unique unit and therefore are less useful for identifying similarity in environmental conditions among CUs.

To identify similarities in environmental drivers in the nearshore marine environment, @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007 describe Marine Adaptive zones for Pacific salmon which reflect "watershed-coastal ecosystems of distinct physical characteristics, including the full sequence of riverine, estuarine, and near-short marine habitats used by juvenile anadromous salmonids" (p.14). There are 12 Marine Adaptive zones for Pacific salmon in BC and the Yukon, ranging from the Strait of Georgia in the south to the Bering Sea in the north (COSEWIC 2021 in prep.). Although SMUs are usually defined to be spatially cohesive and therefore may capture CUs with similar environmental conditions, SMUs and their component CUs sometimes span multiple biogeoclimatic zones and Marine Adaptive zones.  

CUs containing unique biogeoclimatic or Marine Adaptive zones within an SMU may have divergent statuses and trends from neighbouring CUs, either directly due to the different environments or their interaction with other natural drivers and anthropogenic threats.


CUs with similar **life-history characteristics** are more likely to respond to common threats and environmental drivers in the same way compared with those with divergent characteristics. For example, Chinook Salmon exhibit at least two distinct life-histories, named stream and ocean types. Stream-type fish rear for more than a year in freshwater and tend to migrate far offshore during their marine stage, whereas ocean-type fish migrate to the ocean as subyearlings (< 1 year) and tend to remain near shore during marine life. These different emigration patterns are believed to have evolved as a consequence of differences in food resources and survival rates in the freshwater and marine environments, and result in different vulnerabilities to physical and biological conditions in those environments.  CUs with different life-history characteristics cannot be used to represent each under data deficiencies. In some cases, SMUs have been defined to account for differences in life-history in order to better achieve joint status under common management regime (e.g., Fraser Chinook where SMUs are defined in part based on dominant ages at maturity). In other SMUs, CUs with various life-history types are combined (e.g., the Mainland Inlet Chinook SMU which contains CUs with ocean and stream-type fish) <!--CH: to confirm with Diana and Ron. CU34-HOMATH (ocean-type) and CU35-KLINA (stream-type) both in Mainland Inlets CK SMU-->.

CUs with very different **habitat capacities** may respond differently to similar threats. For example very small CUs may be more vulnerable to moderate fishing pressure if abundances drop below critical conservation thresholds, e.g., 1000 fish, where as very large CUs may more resilient to common threats.    <!--CH: I think about COSEWIC criteria which identify DUs < 1000 as Threatened, and also DUs < 10,000 with declining trend as Threatened. For Pacific salmon, the habitat capacity of CUs can span this range (<1000 to >10,000) making some CUs inherently more vulnerable than others, presumably.-->

Overall, our goal in this step is to identify if threats, environments, life-history characteristics and habitat capacities are sufficiently similar among CUs such that status and trends are likely to be consistent. In some cases natural variability alone may result in differences in status and trends even if these criteria are met. In a meta-analysis of spawner time-series across Pacific salmon species throughout BC using data extracted from the Pacific Salmon Explorer Tool (PSE 2021)<!--CH: have to add ref to this URL. Add number of time-series included-->,  pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs within SMUs tend to be positive for Pink, Chum, Coho, and Sockeye Salmon (Appendix Figure <!-- add Connors unpublished, or add Brendan as co-author. later preferable-->), providing some support for the use of data-rich CUs to inform those without data for those species. One caveat of this analysis is that CUs with available time-series tend to be more heavily managed and may not be representative of those without data which tend to be remote and without direct management interventions. In addition, the four criteria described above were not accounted for in selecting SMUs for inclusion, and so correlations may be biased low. For Chinook Salmon, correlations were more variable among CUs and sometimes negative, possibly due to the inclusion of CUs dominated by both stream-type and ocean-type fish within some SMUs. <!--CH: to check with with Brendan-->

Overall, we suggest caution when representing SMU status  with only a subset of CUs, and recommend evaluating and documenting the risks of incorrectly assigning status of data deficient CUs based on neighboring CUs. <!-- ask Brendan which SMUs were negative to improve this guidance piece-->. We also recommend further quantitative evaluation of these criteria using empirical data disaggregated by environmental zones, life-history types and management intensity, among other variables, supported by simulation evaluation.  These criteria are not meant to be prescriptive, but to provide general guidelines for assessing possible inference for data deficient CUs. 

If data-deficient CUs do not meet the criteria for inference from the remaining CUs within an SMU, we recommend collection of CU-level data to inform biological assessments. Data collection would therefore be prioritized for CUs that diverge in threats, environmental drivers, life-history capacities and/or habitat capacities from neighbouring CUs. <!--CH: Brendan suggested interim LRPs, but I"m not sure if/when they would apply. If DD CUs don't meet the criteria above, then we should not recommend developing LRPS from remaining CUs period. If  'interim' LRPs are those from SMUs with DD CUs that do meet the above criteria, this would capture amost all of our SMUs I think.   Do we want to call these interim LRPs if collecting data for those remote CUs isn't practical/feasible and we think they probably covary with other CUs based on our criteria?  We should prioritize collection of data for CUs that fail to meet the criteria above, over those that meet them. Perhaps we can bring this up at the next TWG mtg.-->
<!--CH: on second thought, given the results from the IFR analysis removing CUs, showing that the CU status is usually biased positive (overoptimistic) when only a subset of CUs are used, maybe it is appropriate for us to call these interim LRPs?-->

### Proportion of CUs Above Red Status Required to Avoid Serious Harm (Step 4)

The identification of serious harm is a science-based activity, independent of management processes. Given the goal of the Wild Salmon Policy to protect the biodiversity of Pacific salmon in part through the maintaining CUs above lower biological benchmarks, we have identified 100$\%$ of CUs as an LRP that will avoid serious harm. Exceptions to this may occur where there is uncertainty or mis-identification in the delineation of CUs (e.g., as for some transboundary CUs @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007) or CUs deemed extinct. Those CUs would be omitted from the total number of (extant) CUs within the SMU. This step does not include cost-benefit trade-offs associated with choosing which CUs to prioritize if only a portion can be conserved under growing threats, including climate change. Those analyses would require collaboration with various sectors involved in management of the SMU, beyond those involved in the science-based process of identifying LRPs. Some CUs may be naturally more vulnerable to threats because of their biological or population characteristics (e.g., due to small habitat capacities), however, that natural vulnerability does not diminish the serious harm associated with the biodiversity loss if that CU is lost in the face of ongoing threats. <!--CH: this last sentence is meant to get at the possible exemption of CUs that are naturally at low abundance and "red". The counter argument I heard at the TWG meeting was that those CUs still have ongoing threats and so separating 'natural' vulnerability from threats that deplete a CU is tricky, and probably too hard for us to attempt. And the loss of any CU is serious harm.".-->  In addition, for some CUs the potential for rebuilding to above the red zone may be extremely low. These considerations should be identified in a rebuilding potential analysis to prioritize where resources should be allocated under limited resources in a rebuilding plan (e.g., @carwardinePriorityThreatManagement2019).  Considerations on rebuilding potential are outside scope of identifying LRPs.

Furthermore, unlike other marine fisheries, threats and management levers for Pacific salmon extend beyond those associated with fisheries that underlie the definition of SMUs and LRPs. The scale of SMUs is often incongruent with the scale of dominant threats and management levers so that LRPs based on 100$\%$ of CUs being above red status may trigger the development of rebuilding plans under Fish Stock provisions when only a component (e.g., a single CU) requires intervention possibly using non-fisheries related levers (e.g., hatcheries or habitat amelioration).  Nevertheless, we have identified 100$\%$ of CUs within the SMU as serious harm under the Fish Stock provisions; triggers and interventions at finer and coarser spatial scales will also be essential to sustain Pacific salmon.<!--CH: This is meant to capture the concern that we might trigger RP when CU is already being managed in other ways, and at a different scales-->


Once LRPs are identified, SMU-level objectives and management procedures can then be evaluated in cost-benefit analyses to identify those approaches that best meet objectives, including the prioritization of CU-specific interventions. Furthermore, objectives and management actions can be adapted to a range of spatial scales from CU to regional or multi-SMU scales and then evaluated in a hierarchical context. The proposed LRP presented here of 100$\%$ of component CUs above the red status within an SMU is a first step in that process.


### Assess Status Relative to Proportion-based LRP (Step 5)

The status of individual CUs is assessed and the proportion of CUs with status above red is then compared to the LRP of 100% identified from step 4. 

Where available, we recommend applying CU assessments from recent WSP Integrated Status Assessments, in which multiple metrics, such as abundances and short- and long-term trends, are integrated to assign CU status within an expert-driven process [@dfoCanadaPolicyConservation2005a; @grant2017FraserSockeye2020]. Here we define recent as within the most recent generation as a general guideline, though major perturbations such as landslide events may make even recent assessments unrepresentative of current conditions if the impact of those events are not accounted for. <!--CH remove: Over time-periods longer than an generation, the extent to which the assessment is still representative depends on the dynamics of the specific system.-->

Because WSP Integrated status assessments are time-intensive processes and are not available for most CUs, we demonstrate the application of a Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool that is being developed by DFO's State of the Salmon Program to rapidly assess CU status under the WSP multi-dimensional assessment framework (Pestal et al. in prep). More details on this approach are provided in a companion working paper (Holt et al. in prep)<!--CH: I adapted this sentence and the next sentence from the CaseStudy WP, Ch2. Also, should I refer to Ch 2 of this paper instead/in addition; Ch2 of this WP will briefly describe the approaches as well?-->
                                                                                                                  While the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool captures the multiple dimensions that are used to inform biological status under the WSP, we compared resulting status to a simplified approach derived from a single metric, spawner abundances relative to its lower benchmark. In this way, we demonstrated how in most cases the Rapid Multidimensional Scanning Tool reduces to this single metric. The simplified single-metric assessment is one component of the Multidimensional Scanning Tool, a tool which captures additional dimensions of status providing a more comprehensive assessment.
                                                                                                                                                                           
### Peer-review Assessments of Status Relative to Proportion-based LRP (Step 6)

We recommend peer-review of the CU data and assessments used in steps 1 and 5, if CU assessment are developed outside of an existing published, peer-reviewed process. Also, we recommend peer-review of decisions about SMU-scale aggregation from steps 2, 3 and 4. This peer review can occur, at least in part, through DFO's State of the Salmon Program's annual implementation of the Rapid Multidimenstional Scanner Tool. The Scanner Tool will be applied annually as part of of a process integrating Tool outputs with local expertise to provide provisional statuses for CUs. Expert review is required to vet statuses derived from the implementation of the Scanner Tool to ensure they are consistent with underlying biological definitions (e.g., WSP red zone is associated with elevated risk of extinction) given the multiple and sometimes conflicting dimensions of status. <!--CH: Ann-Marie suggested an example from Fraser Sockeye Shuswap here, but I wonder if it might make the flow of this section awkward?--> The outputs from that process can be used as a basis for developing CU-level statuses to inform SMU-level LRPs. For CUs or SMUs not included or not fully reviewed in that annual process and where SMU-scale LRPs are required, we recommend a separate SMU-scale peer-review process that includes assessment of component CUs and decisions about data deficiencies and CU representatives, covering steps 1-5.
                                                                                                                                                                           
The frequency of SMU-scale peer reviews outside of the annual implementation of the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool will depend on variability in CU-level population dynamics over time and how LRPs and SMU-level assessments are used to inform decision making (e.g., if an SMU is batched under the Fisheries Act), among other factors. In the future, management procedures with various frequencies of assessments could be evaluated in a simulation framework to identify risks of delaying assessments relative to costs of implementing them. 

### Are Aggregate Abundance-Based LRPs Required For Fisheries Management? (Step 7)

LRPs can be used to inform a variety of management decisions (as described in the section, \@ref(roleLRPs)).  Although proportion-based LRPS are sufficient under Fish Stock provisions for Pacific salmon, alternative, abundance-based LRPs may be required for fisheries management decision making. For SMUs where harvest is a dominant driver of population dynamics and restricting fisheries harvest is a principle lever, abundances of the SMU as an aggregate and an LRP along that metric may support precautionary management. As aggregate abundances drop towards an LRP, fishing pressure can be gradually curtailed to avoid depletion below the LRP. The choice to develop an aggregate-abundance based LRP depends on the decision context, a choice that would be made in collaboration with sectors responsible for decisions within the SMU.                                                              

Aggregate-abundance based LRPs are scientifically derived quantities that delineate serious harm to an SMU following the same principles outlined in the \@ref(intro). Although these LRPs can inform harvest control rules, harvest management decisions require consideration of multiple objectives beyond those associated with conservation and serious harm (e.g., socioeconomic objectives). Furthermore, harvest control rules that use a variety of management levers can be developed independent of aggregate-abundance based LRPs. For example, time-area closures limiting harvest on specific CUs and hatchery and habitat enhancement can be implemented to support CU-specific  objectives and achieve proportion-based LRPs regardless of aggregate abundances.

If aggregate-abundance based LRPs are not required, assessment of the SMU would be provided from steps 1-6. The following steps (8-12) are relevant if aggregate-abundance based LRPs are required, and build on the proportion-based LRP derived in the previous steps. 

### What is Acceptable Probability of Achieving Proportion-Based LRP? (Step 8)

Aggregate-abundance based LRPs are defined to be consistent with the WSP objective of maintaining biodiversity at the scale of CUs. First, an acceptable probability of achieving the proportion-based LRP (i.e., all CUs above red status) is identified. We provide a range of probabilities and their definitions adapted from likelihood scale used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ref, to be added), instead of specifying a single probability. DFO's Guidelines for the Implementation of Fish Stock Provisions states “Unless otherwise defined in stock-specific precautionary approach frameworks, the LRP should be considered breached if the terminal year stock status indicator is estimated to be at or below the LRP with a greater than 50$\%$ probability or if the projected stock status indicator falls below the LRP with a greater than 50$\%$ probability under a zero catch scenario in a 1 year projection” [@dfoScienceGuidelinesSupport2021]. This definition of breaching an LRP suggests a risk neutral approach to identifying serious harm, whereby risks may be accounted for directly and explicitly in harvest control rules that trade-off multiple objectives. In our case studies, we have focused on aggregate-abundances with 50$\%$ probability of achieving proportion-based LRPs.

### Choose among aggregate-abundance based LRPs (Step 9)

Guidelines for choosing among two types of aggregate-abundance based LRPs are described here: empirical logistic-regression based LRPs and projection-based LRPs that use historical data or projected data, respectively to identify the relationship between aggregate abundances and the probability that all CUs are above red status. These guidelines are derived from the validity of assumptions that each method is based on. If assumptions are not met for either aggregate-abundance LRP method, then developing aggregate-abundance based LRPs that are aligned with the WSP may not be possible for this SMU. See Section on Future Research <!--CH: insertlink--> for approaches for developing and evaluating management procedures for these SMUs that account for CU-level statuses.



#### Empirical logistic-regression based LRPs

Empirical logistic-regression based LRPs are derived from historical time-series of proportion of CUs above red status, indicated by either the multidimensional status or a single metric. 
<!--CH: the next few sentences can be adjusted if Catarina is able to run logistic regression with multi-dimenstional asssessment for IFR coho. However, do we need to do the same thing for ISC chum & again show that the diagnostics don't work for the logistic regression based on the multi-dimenstional CU statuses?-->
For the demonstration purposes, we have applied the single metric, abundances greater than lower benchmarks for our case studies (with one exception for Interior Fraser Coho Salmon where distribution of spawning is also considered, see Holt et al in prep.). Future analyses could include status derived in the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool, though we do not anticipate significant changes to our applications on case studies because status from the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner was either identical or very similar to status derived from abundances relative to the lower benchmark.

We suggest that LRPs based on logistic regressions may be appropriate when the following criteria are met:

- As required for proportional-based benchmarks, data-deficient CUs meet criteria outlined in Step 3 such that their status can be represented by CUs with data. 

- Time-series of the proportion of CUs above the lower benchmark (or above red status) contain contrast such that all CUs are above their lower benchmark (or red status) in at least one year and at least 1 CU is below its lower benchmark (or has red status) in at least one year.

- There is a significant positive relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark (or red status) without influential outliers, which is supported by model diagnostics described in Holt et al. in prep. This relationship is more likely to be positive when pairwise correlations in spawner abundances are strong and positive among CUs. For example, for Interior Fraser Coho, goodness-of-fit diagnostics identified a significant relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmarks (p<0.01) and the average pairwise spawner correlations among CUs was relatively high, 0.43 (Holt et al. in prep). In contrast, for Inside South Coast Chum, the same Goodness-of-Fit diagnostic was not statistically significant (p>0.05) and average pairwise spawner correlations was relatively weak, <0.13."  <!--CH: Check exact cor values-->

- Residuals for logistic regression model fit are independent, i.e., not temporally autocorrelated
<!--CH comment: KH and CW, I'd especially like your thoughts on the next two-->
- Environmental drivers and threats among CUs have remained stable over the available time-series, or have changed in the same way across CUs such that covariance in population dynamics among CUs is likely to have remained stable over time, and hence the relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all CUs being above lower benchmarks is also likely to have remained stable. 

- For logistic-regression models based on CU-level abundance-based metrics, CU-level population dyanmics have either not changed or they have changed in a reversible way such that benchmarks do not vary over time. Reversible changes in population productivity or capacity may warrant management actions to recover the CU to the benchmarks based on historical data. 

LRPs based on logistic regressions may not be appropriate when:

- Data-deficient CUs do not meet criteria outlined in Step 3 such that their status cannot be represented by CUs with data

- Time-series of the proportion of CUs above the lower benchmark (or above red status) are equal to 100% for all years, or less than 100% for all years

- The relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark (or red status) is not statistically significant or contains influential outliers. In other words, model diagnostics do not support the use of logistic regression. The relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark is more likely to be insignificant when pairwise correlations in spawner abundances are weak or negative among CUs.

- Residuals for logistic regression model fit are temporally autocorrelated such that status in one year depends on the status in the previous year

- Threats and/or environmental drivers have changed  such that CU-level benchmarks estimated from historical data no longer meaningful, and there is no expectation that these changes will be reverted naturally of achieved through management

<!--CH comment: KH and CW, I'd also really like your thoughts on the next two, mirroring the last two in the subsection above-->
- Environmental drivers and threats among CUs have changed over the available time-series such that covariance in population dynamics among CUs is likely to have changed. 

- For logistic-regression models based on CU-level abundance-based metrics, environmental drivers and/or threats have changed CU-level population dynamics and there is no expectation that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management, such that it may be appropriate to consider time-varying benchmarks. 

#### Projection based LRPs

Projection-based LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics and associated time-series of CUs above red status indicated by a single metric, spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. We did not consider CU-status derived from the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool for projection-based LRPs because the projection model identifies long-term equilibrium aggreagate abundances assocoatd with specified probaiblities of a lcomponent CUs being above red-dataus and is not structured to reflect time trends. Time trends can be assessed in simulation models that evalaute management procedures, as in MSEs, independent of this model for identifying projection-based LRPs.<!-- we should mention early in this paper, and in the other paper that projetion-based LRP is an equilibrium approach-->



- CU-specific stock assessment models have been developed and peer reviewed, 
- CU-specific parameters are available for representative CUs (see step 3)
- Plausible bounds can be placed on uncertain parameters (e.g., productivity and capacity), including those that may have changed over the time-series to represent a best-estimate of current conditions. 
- Similar to logistic-regression based LRP, pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs are positive and strong (e.g., > 0.4 as a general rule of thumb)

-	The question of whether a CU within a larger SMU can persist in the red zone is something that could be simulation tested; although, this would require harvest control rules to be specified for testing.  Such an approach would be case-specific and outside of the scope of our work.  However, we could consider recommending that if a decision is made for a CU to allow some proportion of CUs to be in the red zone, quantitative evaluation (e.g., simulation testing) should be used to demonstrate that red CUs will not be lost. [Although, we may still want to consider putting some bounds on what proportion would be allowed to be below their lower benchmark, i.e., a large proportion of CUs persisting in the red zone may not be acceptable ].

-if using $<$100 $\%$ of CUs $>$ red, could recommend simulation testing





### Aggregate-abundance LRP based on CU-specific data

-	Based on experience applying LRPs to case studies, develop recommendations on when aggregate abundance LRPs are appropriate or not. Do these recommendations depend on the number of CUs (e.g., what if the SMU only has 1 or 2 CUs)?

### Empirical vs. projected approaches for aggregate-abundance LRPS

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How do projection-based and empirical LRPs (and their uncertainties) compare?
-	What type of data and level of data-quality is required to support historic LRPs? 	How robust are empirical LRPs to different underlying scenarios (model formulations, observation errors, time-varying productivity and capacity)?
- What type of data and level of data-quality is required to support projected LRPs?  How robust are prospective LRPs to different underlying scenarios (model formulations, covariance in CU dynamics, implementation error, observation errors, time-varying productivity and capacity)
- Are projected LRPs always preferred when possible?  Under what circumstances are empirical LRPs warranted? Projected LRPs are appropriate when stock-recruitment models have been developed and peer-reviewed for component CUs. LRPs are highly sensitive to the choice of the stock-recruitment model, so this needs careful consideration.
-	To consider: could a projection-based approach be used for periodic intensive assessments and an empirical (logistic regression) approach be sufficient for annual updates?


## Guidance on scale of diversity used to define aggregate-abundance LRPs

Questions to provide guidance on:
-	When it is appropriate to group CUs together or split CUs into smaller sub-components?
- This should be identified on an SMU-by-SMu basis
- What (SMU-level) process should be recommended to decide the scale of assessment necessary to represent serious harm? 


## Guidance on the application of aggregate abundance LRPs

-	Modelling approaches: advantages and disadvantages of using integrated models to propagate uncertainty from stock-recruitment models through to LRP estimates (highlight integrated Sgen-LRP model and Watershed-Area model)
-	Recommended software: e.g., TMB, TMBstan, R
-	Recommended process:Do we recommend a CSAS review every time an LRP is identified for a SMU
- One option- we could recommend a CSAP Science Response for relatively stratigh-forward appications of the two aggregate abundance methods that we focus on here. In cases where other approaches, (e.g., multi-dimensional) or unique circumstances arise that have not been covered in this guidance document, a full CSAS Science Review should be considered.
- CSAS Special Science Responses (SSRs) could document and review LRPs for several SMUs at once (or review several SSR within one meeting)
- In some cases, LRPs could be documented and reviewed within rebuilding plan. For LRPs, but this would not cover SMUs that are batched, but do not require rebuilding plans.
- Look to National Working Group for guidance on required documentation and review of LRPs. What is required for other species?
- Suggestion to provide some flexibility when applying these methods given local context and data (e.g,, local expertise required when providing justification for persistence of CUs in the red zone; enhancement).

-	What is the appropriate measure of current abundances to compare against LRPs?
- To minimize annual variability in assessments and be consistent with WSP assessments (and other jurisdictions), we recommend using aggregate generational average abundance when comparing current SMU abundance to LRPs

## Selection of CU-level abundance-based benchmarks to use as a basis for LRP estimation (Placeholder)

Placeholder.  Thorough exploration of this topic may be out of scope for this Working Paper. We may decide that we do not need to go into this much detail given previous work that has been done to evaluate WSP benchmarks.

Intended to address TWG ToR objective: Evaluate and provide guidance on candidate lower biological benchmarks for data-limited CUs (e.g., percentile and watershed area-based approaches).


Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How do data availability and biological considerations interact to inform a decision about which CU-level benchmark to use? (e.g, Sgen from SSR vs. Sgen from Watershed-Area vs. percentile vs. distributional benchmarks, etc)?  
-	Under what conditions should Watershed-Area based LRPs be used?	
- How do mean and distributions (uncertainties) of watershed-area based and stock-recruitment based benchmarks compare?
- Under which levels of data uncertainties do stock-recruitment based LRPs outperform habitat-based LRPs? 
- In cases where watershed-area based benchmarks and stock-recruitment based benchmarks are available, both should be presented and used to derive complementary LRPs to capture our underlying model uncertainties.
- Alternatively, could be combined by using watershed area to inform prior on beta in the stock-recruitment model
- What if stocks have different levels of data, e.g., Fraser Sockeye, where stock-recruitment as available for some CUs, while others have only escapement data.  When is it beneficial to use available data for data poor CUs vs when to exclude them?

## Incorporating uncertainty in aggregate abundance LRP estimation

-	Parameter uncertainty can be incorporated through estimation methods (MLE with confidence intervals, Bayesian analyses, stochastic projections for the Projected LRP method).  However, larger structural uncertainties in model formulation will require consideration of reference and robustness scenarios to evaluate sensitivity of LRPs to those structural uncertainties.
-	How should uncertainty in benchmarks be incorporated in the LRP if different methods are used to estimate CU-level status within an SMU (i.e., some CUs have stock-recruitment benchmarks, while others rely on percentile-based or habitat-based benchmarks). Bootstrapping from uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks could be considered in these cases. Although, simulation testing of these scenarios may be outside the scope of this paper, guidance based on best-practices from the literature could be provided.
- For abundance-based empirical LRPs uncertainty in the relationship between aggregate abundance and the probability of that all CUs are above their lower benchmarks is provided by the CI's from the logistic regression
- Also, for both empirical and projected LRPs, that uncertainty can, to some extent, be demonstrated in sensitivity of the LRP to different choices of probability levels. If the LRP is very sensitive to probability level (50, 66, 90), this indicates the relationship between aggregate abundance and presence of CUs below their lower benchmark is uncertain. The the range in LRPs along various plausible p-values can be compared to the range of observed spawner abundances.
Questions to provide guidance on:
-	How should alternative model formulations be considered when identifying LRPs?  (e.g., integrated into a single LRP or presented as two different LRPs?)

## Time-varying parameters and impacts on LRPs

There is increasing evidence of time varying parameters in Pacific salmon populations, particularly relating to declines in productivity [e.g., @holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020,  @dornerSpatialTemporalPatterns2018, @malickRegionalScaleDeclinesProductivity2016, petermanWidespreadDecreaseProductivity2012]. In Canada, DFO assessments identified declines in productivity for various conservation units, e.g., Fraser sockeye [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011, @grantIntegratedBiologicalStatus2013, @huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021], Southern BC Chinook (cite SAR 2016/042), Fraser Chinook (Cite RPA)  and Interior Fraser Coho [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020]. These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the evaluation of trends in log spawners per recruit [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020], evaluation of trends in residuals from recruitment curve fits [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011], and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when fitting recruitment curves using Kalman filter or recursive Bayes approach [huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021 and RPA].

Time-varying parameters affect estimates for stock recruitment reference points (e.g. $Smsy$ and $Sgen$) and are also likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations. These effects will have an impact on the classification of CUs status. However determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g. AIC and BIC) often produce conflicting results [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020]. A review of stock-recruit analyses for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters, highlighted that even when there is strong evidence for non-stationarity in salmon populations, it is not clear if reference points should me adjusted accordingly [@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021].

There are no clear guidelines on how to proceed in terms of translating time-varying stock recruitment parameters into reference points. The time-varying dynamics usually occur at the conservation unit level, therefore the implications for SMU-based LRPs are not straightforward. Effects of non-stationarity of CU recruitmanet dynamics on aggregate and proportion-based LRPs will depend on  the degree of synchrony between stocks, the direction of the change in recruitment parameters, and the past and current stock status. In addition, if time-varying reference points are considered, it is difficult to define how often they should be changed. Mistimed changes in reference points may lead to bias in stock status [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020] and Volatility of management benchmarks may lead to management uncertainty and reduce trust in the management process [@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021].

The Precautionary approach policy recommends that changes to the reference points should only be adjusted when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management [@dfoHarvestStrategyCompliant2006]. Klaer et al 2015 devised a framework for evaluation the degree of confidence in productivity shifts in Australian fisheries, similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian Salmon populations. Recent studies recommend the use of case specific feedback simulation exercises in order to determine the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non-stationary [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020; @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021]. However, full feedback simulation studies might not be feasible for every conservation unit due to limited resources. Future research should focus on identifying general advice on the best practices for adjusting benchmarks when the stock dynamics is thought to be non-stationary.

Notes from LRP check in. 
Need to highlight that time-varying dynamics usually occur at the conservation unit level, therefore the implications for MU-based LRPs are not straightforward. Effects of non-stationarity of CU recruitmanet dynamics on aggregate and proportion-based LRPs will depend on  the degree of synchrony between stocks, the direction of the change in recruitment parameters, and the past and current stock status.    

CW comment: I am not sure if we want to formalize a LRP recommendation here, or just say that this question requires further consideration? 
Also may want to highlight that time-varing parameters will likely occur at the CU level, and is unlikely to affect all the CU's within an MU homogeneously. 

old notes
-	Briefly document evidence for time-varying productivity for Pacific salmon
-	Summarizing recent DFO CSAS documents that include discussion of time-varying reference points for Pacific salmon, and recent primary publications:
- Summarize approach for considering time-varying productivity in WSP CU assessments (e.g., Kalman filter on productivity parameters))

@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 reviews stock recruitment analysis for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters. They highlight that even though there might be strong evidence for non stationarity in salmon populations, it is not clear if reference points should me adjusted accordingly. 

@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 recommends that any decision to introduce time-varying reference points be based on evidence supporting that rebuilding could reasonably be expected. They recommend the use of feedback simulations to illustrate the consequences of time-varying benchmarks and identify exceptional circumstances that should lead to re-examination of reference point and management measures. 

 @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021 illustrates the effects of time-varying recruitment parameters on MSY-based reference points for iteroparous fish stocks (cod and plaice). They highlight that more precautionary benchmarks are necessary to account for the parameter uncertainty in highly dynamic ecosystems. However, they observed that effects on reference points depend on the magnitude and structure of the stochasticity in stock-recruitment relationships, therefore they recommend case specific simulation studies be performed to identify explicit impacts on MSY-based reference points.
