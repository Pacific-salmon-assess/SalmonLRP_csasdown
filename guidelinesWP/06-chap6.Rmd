# Recommendations for Future Work {#recommendations}

Should highlight the identification of questions / outstanding guidance that were beyond our scope

- Specific questions about how well index sites within a CU represent the CU as a whole (i.e., representativeness question, but for sites within a CU instead of CUs within an SMU)

- Consideration of additional habitat-based benchmarks

- Suggestion to consider all three management levers in LRP development: harvest, hatcheries and habitat. Should LRPs be identified along those three dimensions and/or integrate information for those 3 levers?

- Standard versus hierarchical stock-recruitment models for estimating benchmarks
