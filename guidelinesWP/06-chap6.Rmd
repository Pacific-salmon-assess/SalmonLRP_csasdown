## KEY UNCERTAINTIES THAT AFFECT LRP ESTIMATES


### CU assessments

Uncertainties in CU assessments affect both proportion-based and aggregate abundance-based LRPs, and arise because of uncertainties in underlying data, estimation uncertainty in the statistical models underlying benchmarks, and structural uncertainties in model forms, including which biological metrics and spatial scales to consider. Observations errors in spawner abundances, catches, stock assignment of catches, and ages-at-maturity can result in data uncertainties, which may impact estimates of recruitment in 'run reconstructions' and assessment of status. In addition, short time-series or those with missing values can increase uncertainties in assessments. However, @peacockEvaluatingConsequencesCommon2020 found that CU status assessments were generally robust to most common assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase rates of status misclassification. The magnitude and distribution of these uncertainties will be CU- and species-dependent.

The impact of hatchery enhancement on spawner and recruitment time-series is a key uncertainty due to the low rates of visible marking among hatcheries. Even when data on the proportion of hatchery-origin fish are available and abundance time-series are adjusted to account for these (as in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study), the genetic impacts of hatchery enhancement can perpetuate over multiple generations [@arakiCarryoverEffectCaptive2009; @christieReproductiveSuccessEarlygeneration2014], but are difficult to quantify because second generation hatchery-origin fish are not marked or monitored. This is a source of uncertainty for populations impacted by within-basin hatchery facilities and those impacted by straying out-of-basin. Targeted marking and monitoring of spawning grounds for mark proportions and genetic analyses to identify genetic introgression from strays would help address these uncertainties.  

Further, for stocks that are not dominated by hatchery production, the decision to exclude the contribution of hatchery-origin fish from time-series of spawner abundances where possible assumes that these fish do not contribute to assessment and resulting management of wild salmon, as in previous WSP assessments [e.g., @dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015], despite their possible contribution to conservation and rebuilding objectives, and ecosystem services in general. A review and evaluation of objectives for integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations (with PNI  $\geqslant$ 0.5), and the appropriate data on which to base assessments was beyond the scope of this project. 

For benchmarks estimated from spawner-recruitment relationships, uncertainties from the estimation process can be shown in 95% CIs (or 95% credible intervals for Bayesian analyses). However, observation errors in the independent variable (spawner abundances) can bias parameter estimates (errors-in-variables), as can correlations that occur when spawner abundance in a given year depends on recruitment in the previous generation [time-series biases, @waltersFisheriesEcologyManagement2004].

Structural uncertainty in stock-recruitment models underlying benchmark estimation can swamp other sources of uncertainty, and requires careful consideration based on available data and biological understanding of the population dynamics, ideally with peer review.  We provide one example of structural uncertainty in the Interior Fraser River Coho study based on prior assumptions about population capacity, but other components, such as decisions about depensation at low abundances, shared or independent variability in productivity among CUs, and Beverton-Holt versus Ricker forms should be considered.  

Uncertainties in percentile-based benchmarks can be calculated from bootstrapped confidence intervals of benchmarks accounting for autocorrelation in spawner abundances [@peacockEvaluatingConsequencesCommon2020; @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. Uncertainties in their implementation can arise because of uncertainties in estimates of productivity and harvest rates that are used to categorize populations to identify appropriate percentiles to use [as described in  @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. 

Uncertainties in benchmarks derived from the watershed-area model [@parkenHabitatbasedMethodsEstimate2006; liermannUsingAccessibleWatershed2010] were approximated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals . Because the watershed-area model was parameterized based on a meta-analysis of spawner-recruit data sets that were outdated (ending in 2000) and likely more productive compared with for populations in our case study, we derived productivity estimates and uncertainties from a life-stage specific model for WCVI Chinook combined with expert opinion. 
<!--CH comment to CW: Catarina, now that you've reminded me about the delta method, I'm not sure I estimated CIs correctly here. I used 95%CI of SREP (capacity) from TMB outputs, and then used a distribution of productivity from expert opinion (leaning on Wilf's life-stage model) and drew randomly from both to get a bootstrapped 95% CI of Sgen, where Sgen is F(Srep, prod). Is this okay mathematically?
CH: not it's not, but have used 95%CIS to apprpoximate credible intervals for now...
-->

Uncertainties in peer-reviewed WSP assessments are captured qualitatively through narratives associated with each CU assessment [e.g., @dfoWildSalmonPolicy2015] derived from experts integrating uncertainties in data and estimation of benchmarks and reconciling conflicting metrics. This process requires careful consideration of expertise included to ensure that best available information is incorporated in assessments and associated description of uncertainties.  

Although uncertainties in status derived from the Salmon Scanner are not currently provided, this functionality is being considered for future iterations of the tool. The Salmon Scanner is applied annually within an expert-driven process led by DFO's State of the Salmon Program, so underlying uncertainties are considered and outputs are ground-truthed by local experts. A full review of the the Salmon Scanner including uncertainties is forthcoming (Pestal et al. in prep).<!--CH comment: There are many uncertainties associated with this tool, but I'm not sure that it's useful for us to include them here as it will invite discussion on topics that are outside scope. Example uncertainties are that the Tool does not include distributional metrics or productivity which may be important in formal WSP assessments, and the Tool was parameterized based on a set of southern stocks so does not necessarily represent the entire range.-->


### Proportion-based LRPs

Uncertainties in status derived from proportion-based LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are not well represented by data-rich CUs that are included. Even when data-limited CUs have similar threats, environmental conditions and drivers, life-history characteristics and capacities as data-rich CUs, population dynamics may diverge due to other other random variables. We recommend caution when applying interim LRPs that do not include all CUs. In these cases, we recommend developing a monitoring plan to inform CU-specific assessments.


### Logistic-regression based LRPs

For logistic regression-based LRPs, we provide 95% CIs and assess their overlap with current status. These CIs represent uncertainty in the estimation of the logistic regression incorporating uncertainty in the underlying benchmarks (e.g., from spawner-recruitment relationships or the watershed-area model). When estimated in a Bayesian framework, the probability distribution of LRPs can be generated to provide the probability that the current status is above the LRP given uncertainties in the LRP. In future analyses, uncertainty in current spawner abundances could be integrated with uncertainty to derive probabilities of breaching LRPs that accounts for both. 
<!--CH add: "The estimation of logistic regression model can be statistically integrated with estimation of underlying spawner-recruitment relationships at the CU-level when CU status is derived from spawner-recruitment based benchmarks. This statistical integration allow propagate uncertainties from CU level to SMU level."-->

Similar to proportion-based LRPs, uncertainties in logistic regression-based LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are not well represented by data-rich CUs that are included. Further uncertainties in logistic regression-based LRPs can arise if the management system has changed over time such that selectivity among CUs has diverged, or if the covariance in population dynamics has changed due to other natural or anthropogenic factors.<!--CH omit: such that the relationship between aggregate abundances and CU statuses has changed-->  

Logistic regression-based LRPs are derived from proportion of CUs above their lower benchmark on a single metric as a proxy for status on multiple dimensions as implemented in the Salmon Scanner. In some cases, status from a single metric and status from the Salmon Scanner may deviate. These deviations result because of additional metrics considered and the generational smoothed time-series used to assess current status in the Salmon Scanner. Further details on assumptions that are required for logistic regression-based LRPs and conditions when they may be considered are described in Section \@ref(guidelines). 

<!--CH comment: Suggest removing next bullet as I feel like it's getting into the weeds too much, and only makes sense after a bullet describing how logistic regression-based LRPs can be statistically integrated with SR-based benchmarks and CU status.

For logistic regression-based LRPs derived from CU assessments that are independent of spawner-recruitment models (e.g, that use habitat-based benchmarks), it is still be possible to integrate uncertainties from the CU assessments to SMU-level LRPs though bootstrapping methods. For example, where CU benchmark estimates are provided with uncertainties, benchmarks can be sampled from those distributions randomly and used to estimate a distribution of LRPs. In preliminary analyses, this approach was applied to the case study for West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook Salmon to derive uncertainty in logistic regression-based LRPs that accounted for uncertainty in status of component inlets from a watershed-area model. However, because the data did not support the use of logistic regression for that case study, results are not presented, but code to apply this method is available in our repository.
-->

### Projection-based LRPs

Projection-based LRPs explicitly account for underlying uncertainties in population and harvest parameters, such as CU-level productivity and capacity, age-structure, covariance in recruitment deviations, and variability in implementation of fixed exploitation strategies over time and among CUs. The inclusion of structural uncertainty in the form of the stock-recruitment relationship is demonstrated for the case study on Interior Fraser Coho. We recommend a thorough review of assumptions and either including them directly in random sampling in projections or including them as sensitivity analyses.
One caveat of this approach is that the LRP depends on the management procedure applied in the projections, implemented as a constant exploitation strategy for our case studies, which is not uncommon among Pacific salmon SMUs. Projection-based LRPs derived in this way cannot be used to assess status if management procedures changes. 

Similar to proportion-based LRPs, uncertainties in projection-based LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are not well represented by data-rich CUs that are included. Further details on assumptions that are required for projection-based LRPs and conditions when they may be considered are described in Section \@ref(guidelines). 


One difference between projection-based and logistic regression-based LRPs is that for projection-based LRPs, uncertainties in all underlying parameters and CU-level benchmarks are integrated into the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, so that the LRP itself does not have statistical uncertainty associated with it. In contrast, 95% CIs associated with logistic regression-based LRPs account for estimation uncertainty not included in projection-based LRPs. 


## IMPACT OF MISSING CUS ON SMU-LEVEL STATUS

For proportion-based LRPs, if the LRP of 100% of CUs above red status has been breached for an SMU, the inclusion of additional CUs may further deplete or improve status defined as the percentage of CUs above red status, but will not increase status to above the LRP of 100%. In contrast, if the LRP is not breached for an SMU, then the inclusion of additional CUs may deplete status to below the LRP or keep status at 100% of CUs above the red zone.  <!--CH Q: Is this next sentence true for proportion-based LRPs? I know it does NOT apply for logistic regression-based LRPs (topic of following pgh) LW: It makes sense intuitively.--> The power to detect a breach of a proportion-based LRP is relatively weak when the sample size of CUs is small relative to the total number of component CUs. Therefore, statuses that rely on only a small number of CUs tend to be provide more optimistic status than those that include a larger sample of CUs for proportion-based LRPs, as shown for Inside South Coast Chum case study.  This asymmetrical impact of increased monitoring of CUs on SMU status may reduce incentives to extend monitoring to data-deficient CUs.


For logistic regression-based LRPs, we found that removing component CUs from assessments of an SMU tended to increase variability in SMU-level status, which may be more pessimistic or optimistic than when all CUs are considered depending on which CU is removed and the level of covariation among CUs.  For this LRP, the addition of CUs affects the fit of the logistic regression model, which impacts the aggregate abundance-based LRP and status in ways that are difficult to predict *a priori*.


## TIME-VARYING PARAMETERS AND IMPACTS ON LRPS

There is increasing evidence of time varying parameters in Pacific salmon populations, particularly relating to trends in productivity [@dornerSpatialTemporalPatterns2018; @malickRegionalScaleDeclinesProductivity2016; @petermanWidespreadDecreaseProductivity2012]. In Canada, DFO assessments identified declines in productivity for various CUs, e.g., Fraser River Sockeye [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011;  @huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021], Southern BC Chinook [@dfoIntegratedBiologicalStatus2016], and Interior Fraser River Coho [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020]. These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the evaluation of trends in recruits per spawner [@arbeiderInteriorFraserCoho2020], evaluation of trends in residuals from recruitment curve fits [@grantEvaluationUncertaintyFraser2011], and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when fitting recruitment curves using Kalman filter or recursive Bayes approaches [@huangRecoveryPotentialAssessment2021]. 

Time-varying recruitment parameters affect estimates for salmon benchmarks [e.g., S\textsubscript{MSY} and S\textsubscript{gen}, @holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020] and are also likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations [e.g., percentile-based benchmarks, @holtEvaluatingBenchmarksBiological2018]. Analytical methods for time-varying reference points have been proposed for other marine fish species [@amarEvaluationTwoManagement2009; @puntFisheriesManagementClimate2014], some of which have been evaluated empirically and in simulation with mixed results [@olearyComparisonMultipleApproaches2020; @bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019]. However, determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g., AIC and BIC) often produce conflicting results [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020].  @bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019 suggests that dynamic reference points that track changes in underlying population proceses are most useful in situations when stock productivity shifts directionally and the productivity signal is correctly ascertained. In contrast, uncertainty from incorrectly identifying productivity trends can be a major source of inaccuracy in stock status [@bergerCharacterTemporalVariability2019]. 

In a review of stock-recruit analyses for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters, @adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 highlighted that even when there is strong evidence for non-stationarity in salmon populations it is not clear if reference points should be adjusted accordingly.  Where stock depletion is associated with time-varying parameters that are thought be reversible, it may be more appropriate to protect the population from harvest by maintaining high reference points using historical data [@dfoProceedingsNationalWorkshop2013; @szuwalskiClimateChangeNonstationary2016]. @dfoHarvestStrategyCompliant2006 recommend that changes to the reference points should only be adjusted when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management. Furthermore, DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework states that "when developing reference points efforts should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available" [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009]. This information can help identify if reductions in productivity are likely to be irreversible or only slowly reversible. @klaerHowMuchEvidence2015 devised a framework for evaluating the degree of confidence in productivity shifts in Australian fisheries, and similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian salmon populations. 

Even if time-varying benchmarks or reference points are considered, it is difficult to define how often they should be changed [@zhangReportOceanFrontier2021]. Mistimed changes in benchmarks or reference points may lead to bias in stock status [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020] and volatility of management responses may lead to management uncertainty, reducing trust in the management process [@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021]. Recent studies recommend the use of case-specific feedback simulation exercises in order to determine the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non-stationary [@holtImpactTimevaryingProductivity2020; @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021; @olearyComparisonMultipleApproaches2020]. However, full feedback simulation studies might not be feasible for every conservation unit where trends are suspected due to limited resources. Future research should focus on identifying general advice on the best practices for adjusting benchmarks when stock dynamics are thought to be non-stationary.   
 

Time-varying stock-recruitment dynamics usually occur at the CU level, and the implications for SMU-based LRPs that contain multiple CUs are not straightforward. There are no clear guidelines on how to translate time-varying stock recruitment parameters for CUs into aggregate-level LRPs. Effects of time-varying CU recruitment dynamics on aggregate abundance- and proportion-based LRPs will depend on the degree of synchrony among CUs, the direction of the change in recruitment parameters, and past and current stock status, among other factors. For example, in our case study on Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, when consistent reductions in productivity were introduced in one sensitivity analysis (analysis that included informative priors on capacity in CU-level spawner-recruitment models), benchmarks declined for most CUs as did aggregate abundance-based LRP for the SMU. However, in cases where productivity varies at different rates among CUs or capacity changes as well, impacts on CU-level benchmarks and SMU-level LRPs will not be easily predictable. 




## FUTURE RESEARCH & RECOMMENDATIONS

Here we identify three approaches for developing LRPs aligned with the key principles in Section \@ref(principles). Additional approaches may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality, and types, and dimensions of biological status. As methods are developed and revised, SMU statuses can also be updated in accordance with principle 2, using the best available information for the development of LRPs. 

In particular, while the definition of serious harm under DFO's Precautionary Approach Framework includes impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fishing opportunities [@dfoFisheryDecisionMakingFramework2009], the assessment of harm to these components depends to some extent on the time-frame being considered. Assessments that include only very recent data may miss large declines in status and ecosystem impacts that occurred historically before the advent of modern survey records. In some cases, considering a longer view from genetic, archeological, paleoecological, or Indigenous Knowledge has demonstrated that recent declines are part of much larger historical declines associated with large-scale ecosystem impacts [@eckertDivingBackTime2018; @leeDiverseKnowledgeSystems2019; @priceGeneticsCenturyOld2019; @mckechnieArchaeologicalDataProvide2014] 

Indigenous Knowledge has been considered in the development of target reference points for fisheries management [@caddyReferencePointsFisheries1995], and there is value in further considering its role in identifying serious harm. @reidTwoEyedSeeingIndigenous2020 introduce the concept of Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw), where both indigenous and western science perspectives are valued though the process of, “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all”.  By understanding serious harm, reference points, and other concepts and goals related to LRPs from both indigenous and mainstream scientific perspectives, LRPs may better reflect underlying biological processes understood through both knowledge systems. <!--CH: I see the internal inconsistency here where our direction from NHQ is to provide scientifically based LRPs, yet reconciliation says we should change our perspective and not focus entirely on western science. However, our TWG really wasn't equipped to do this and was beyond our ToR-->

<!--CH omit: too focused on Scanner tool for this paper and would need reworking... "More specifically, methods for CU assessments could further consider serious harm to habitat or ecosystems, for example by extending the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner Tool to account for ecosystem components of serious harm, as well as divergent levels of data quantity and quality among CUs. Furthermore, the Rapid Multidimensional Scanner Tool could be extended to provide management triggers that occur prior to reaching the LRP, for example that require precautionary management and/or increased monitoring, as in @dowlingGuidelinesDevelopingFormal2015."-->


<!--CH suggest removing as I don't want to focus too much on the recommendation for Bayes analyses though I briefly mention this in section on uncertainties. It brings up the Q, why didn't we do it?  Also this is more a guidance piece that future research.
"We recommend that the application of LRPs and SMU status account for uncertainty in CU-level assessments where possible, ideally in  probabilistic framework. For example, for proportion-based LRPs derived from single metrics of status, the probability of all CUs being above lower benchmark could be derived by integrating the probability of CU-level benchmarks from Bayesian estimation and the associated status relative to those benchmarks across all CUs, e.g. by sampling from the posterior distributions of CU-level statuses across all CUs."--> 


We recommend further consideration and evaluation of criteria to identify if data-limited CUs can be represented by data-rich CUs included in analyses. Empirically, these criteria (or other) could be applied to SMUs where CU statuses are available to assess the extent to which statuses covary. Simulation evaluation could further evaluate the extent to which CU statuses on a single metric of status covary under a range of plausible underlying covariance in recruitment, age-structure and exploitation rates. 

In addition, we recommend simulation evaluation of logistic regression-based LRPs and projection-based LRPs to data limitations related to the number of CUs with data, under various assumptions about population dynamics and covariance among CUs. We recommend that these evaluations be parameterized to the SMUs where their application is proposed to ensure results are relevant to the specific context under consideration.


When applying methods to specific case studies, we recommend that aggregate abundance-based LRPs consider major structural uncertainties either through sensitivity analyses or model ensemble approaches. These analyses can determine how sensitive aggregate abundance-based benchmarks are to key model uncertainties, including those related to time-varying parameters, observation errors, and covariance in population dynamics and vulnerability to harvest. In addition, we recommend simulation evaluation be used to assess the robustness of LRPs to violating assumptions given underlying known statuses. Simulation evaluation could further be used to assess the frequency of updates to LRPs required to achieve objectives given underlying changes in model parameters and structure. <!--CH: observation errors in CU-status are relevant for logistic-regression LRPs as they might inflate noise in the LR, and they are relevant to the projection-based LRPs in the noise in the spawner and recruitment data-->


<!--CW: this last paragraph does not read as research recommendation, but as LRP recommendation, I am not sure it belongs here.
Also I don't think that the fact that we did not recommend a probability level for the aggregate abundance-based LRP is a problem. Science will still work on producing tha logistic/projecton-based model, then Management+science+stakeholders will work on setting the probability and time frame for the objective.

CH: I've changed the title of the section to "Future research and recommendations" so that this point can be captured. I think it's our recommendation to policy/FM to work with us to sort it out, as required. Do you think it could be done on a case by case basis, e.g., one SMU at 50% another at 66%, another at 90%?.-->


Although, @dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021 recommends that LRPs under Fish Stock provisions be identified by Science, we were unable to identify a specific probability level for all CUs being above red status that aligned with scientific principles. Although it may be possible to select a probability level based on the IPCC likelihood categorization scheme (e.g., more likely than not, likely, very likely, virtually certain) further guidance on choosing among these options is required. <!--CW -I am not sure if the probability level is part of the LRP. I think it is part of the objective, and as such, it should not be determined by science. LW: related to comments in Ch 4, re: probability higher than 0.5 --> Alternatively, proportion-based LRPs can be used as the basis for serious harm instead of identifying a specific probability for aggregate abundance-based LRPs, where biological objectives for SMUs can be derived from the probability of achieving those proportion-based LRPs over a specified time frame to inform the performance of various candidate management procedures. The probability and time-frame identified within the objective are identified with managers and stakeholders. When used as part of Management Procedure Framework (e.g.,  @dfoManagementProcedureFramework2021) or management strategy evaluation (MSE), the performance of a variety of management procedures against objectives can be evaluated, where management procedures can extend beyond aggregate abundance-based harvest control rules to include time-area closures, habitat enhancement or hatchery supplementation. Therefore, proportion-based LRPs may be preferred as the biological basis of serious harm to clearly distinguish the biologically derived component from desired probability which requires input from managers and stakeholders.





<!--CH: could add Julie's last 2 principles somehow, which are more related applying LRPs, 
Principle 7: Consider whether reference points or indicators should be changed.
Principle 8: Clearly communicate advice on stock status and reference points.-->


<!--

CW: I moved this here from ch 4.
CH: suggest keeping out for  now

- Question: could serious harm may mean extinction rather that in the red zone?  

- The question of whether a CU within a larger SMU can persist in the red zone is something that could be simulation tested; although, this would require harvest control rules to be specified for testing.  Such an approach would be case-specific and outside of the scope of our work.  However, we could consider recommending that if a decision is made for a CU to allow some proportion of CUs to be in the red zone, quantitative evaluation (e.g., simulation testing) should be used to demonstrate that red CUs will not be lost. [Although, we may still want to consider putting some bounds on what proportion would be allowed to be below their lower benchmark, i.e., a large proportion of CUs persisting in the red zone may not be acceptable ].

-if using $<$100 $\%$ of CUs $>$ red, could recommend simulation testing



Beyond scope: CU-level benchmark considerations
- How do data availability and biological considerations interact to inform a decision about which CU-level benchmark to use? (e.g, Sgen from SSR vs. Sgen from Watershed-Area vs. percentile vs. distributional benchmarks, etc)?  
- Under what conditions should Watershed-Area based LRPs be used? 
- How do mean and distributions (uncertainties) of watershed-area based and stock-recruitment based benchmarks compare?
- Under which levels of data uncertainties do stock-recruitment based LRPs outperform habitat-based LRPs? 
- In cases where watershed-area based benchmarks and stock-recruitment based benchmarks are available, both should be presented and used to derive complementary LRPs to capture our underlying model uncertainties.
- Alternatively, could be combined by using watershed area to inform prior on beta in the stock-recruitment model
- What if stocks have different levels of data, e.g., Fraser Sockeye, where stock-recruitment as available for some CUs, while others have only escapement data.  When is it beneficial to use available data for data poor CUs vs when to exclude them?

old notes on time-varying parameters

- Summarizing recent DFO CSAS documents that include discussion of time-varying reference points for Pacific salmon, and recent primary publications:
- Summarize approach for considering time-varying productivity in WSP CU assessments (e.g., Kalman filter on productivity parameters))

@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021 reviews stock recruitment analysis for Pacific salmon, including the use of environmental covariates and time-varying parameters. They highlight that even though there might be strong evidence for non stationarity in salmon populations, it is not clear if reference points should me adjusted accordingly. 

@kronlundConsiderationsDesignRebuilding2021 recommends that any decision to introduce time-varying reference points be based on evidence supporting that rebuilding could reasonably be expected. They recommend the use of feedback simulations to illustrate the consequences of time-varying benchmarks and identify exceptional circumstances that should lead to re-examination of reference point and management measures. 

 @zhangAccountingNonstationaryStock2021 illustrates the effects of time-varying recruitment parameters on MSY-based reference points for iteroparous fish stocks (cod and plaice). They highlight that more precautionary benchmarks are necessary to account for the parameter uncertainty in highly dynamic ecosystems. However, they observed that effects on reference points depend on the magnitude and structure of the stochasticity in stock-recruitment relationships, therefore they recommend case specific simulation studies be performed to identify explicit impacts on MSY-based reference points.
